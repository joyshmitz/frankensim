# Changelog Research

## Scope

- Repo: `Dicklesworthstone/frankensim`
- Requested task: update the changelog using `changelog-md-workmanship`.
- Scope window: project inception on 2026-07-05 through
  `main@e08e30280bcd7af05ae55e990b129d6f75192ead` on 2026-07-09.
- Public remote state when researched: local `HEAD` resolved to
  `e08e30280bcd7af05ae55e990b129d6f75192ead`; `origin/main` resolved to
  `7763bd7eb7a9f0a9c07dc32561df37594a606a99`.
- Working-tree policy: the changelog covers committed history only. Local
  uncommitted documentation refinements and scratch files were not used as
  changelog evidence, including recovery cache, Wrangler cache, and the
  untracked FlowCert probe.

## Evidence Sources

- Git history:
  - `git rev-list --count HEAD` -> 696 commits.
  - `git rev-list --count origin/main` -> 689 commits.
  - `git rev-list --count 43d52f2..HEAD` -> 363 commits since the prior
    changelog baseline.
  - `git rev-list --count fb08842..HEAD` -> 74 commits since the previous
    changelog pass endpoint.
  - `git rev-list --count 319cb64..HEAD` -> 63 commits since the previous
    changelog endpoint.
  - `git log --reverse --no-merges --pretty=format:'%h %ad %s' --date=short`.
  - `git log --all --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H %h %ad %s' --date=short`.
  - `git diff --stat --compact-summary 43d52f2..HEAD` -> 554 files changed,
    101,563 insertions, 519 deletions.
  - `git diff --stat --compact-summary fb08842..HEAD` -> 152 files changed,
    21,481 insertions, 353 deletions.
  - `git diff --stat --compact-summary 319cb64..HEAD` -> 116 files changed,
    16,163 insertions, 369 deletions.
  - `git diff --stat --compact-summary d5873bf..HEAD` -> 23 files changed,
    1,827 insertions, 148 deletions.
- Version metadata:
  - `git for-each-ref refs/tags ...` -> no tags.
  - `gh release list --limit 100` -> no GitHub Releases.
- Tracker:
  - `git show HEAD:.beads/issues.jsonl | jq ...` for closed workstreams and
    close reasons at committed `HEAD`.
- Project docs:
  - `README.md`.
  - `AGENTS.md`.
  - crate-level `CONTRACT.md` files referenced through README/workstream scope.
  - Workspace count checks on 2026-07-09:
    - `find crates -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'fs-*' | wc -l`
      -> 125 crates.
    - `find crates -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name CONTRACT.md | wc -l`
      -> 125 contracts.
    - `git ls-files 'crates/fs-*/tests/*.rs' | wc -l` -> 222 tracked test files.

## Open Questions

- The repo has no formal versioning scheme yet. Future changelog updates should
  split entries by tag/release once the first release is created.
- Links to Beads currently target the committed `.beads/issues.jsonl` file as a
  durable tracker source; a future issue viewer could provide more precise
  per-record URLs.
- Uncommitted local work should only be added after it is committed and proven.

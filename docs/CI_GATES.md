# CI Gates — the Decalogue as machine-checkable policy

Owned by the foundations CI/CD bead. This is the mapping from principle to
mechanical gate, with the honest wiring status of each. Phase gates are
Gauntlet states, not dates (plan §16.1); a gate listed as **deferred** below
is wired the moment its owning crate lands, and this file is updated in the
same change.

## DSR is the CI source of truth

GitHub Actions is unavailable/throttled for this account, so FrankenSim uses
DSR as the primary CI and release runner. Agents should use DSR instead of
waiting on or citing GitHub Actions:

```bash
dsr repos info frankensim
dsr quality --tool frankensim
dsr build frankensim --target darwin/arm64
```

The GitHub workflow files remain in the repo as manual executable specs for the
gate shape and as historical documentation. They are not automatic push/PR
criteria.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsr quality --tool frankensim` | manual DSR command | configured fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, workspace unit + conformance tests, xtask policy gates, constellation drift, required quality lanes, x86 cross-check; see the external-wrapper limitations below |
| `dsr build frankensim --target darwin/arm64` | manual DSR command | native release artifact build for the configured Apple Silicon lane |
| `ci.yml` | manual GitHub dispatch only | archived/manual version of the fmt, clippy, test, policy, and constellation gate shape |
| `nightly.yml` | manual GitHub dispatch only | archived/manual version of the full dev/release suites and retained fs-ledger run record |
| `ci-self-test.yml` | manual | meta-tests: injected failures demonstrably turn the gates red |

### ASCENT conformance profiles

The ASCENT conformance umbrella has a standalone DSR-compatible profile runner
at `scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh`:

```bash
scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh --list pr
scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh --self-test
scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh pr
scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh --list nightly
scripts/ci/ascent_conformance_profile.sh nightly
```

The `pr` profile is an explicit cheap selector spanning the base gradient,
constrained, Pareto, Problem-IR runner, and machine-independent budget-ledger
surfaces. It runs each named integration target separately so one failure does
not hide the remaining rows. The `nightly` profile runs the complete
`fs-ascent` package with Cargo fail-fast disabled, so newly added integration
targets join nightly coverage without hand-maintained selector drift. Both use
`--locked` and emit structured start, per-target, and terminal profile rows.

The default aggregate wall budgets are 900 seconds for `pr` and 7200 seconds
for `nightly`; `FS_ASCENT_PR_BUDGET_SECONDS` and
`FS_ASCENT_NIGHTLY_BUDGET_SECONDS` may override them for an explicitly declared
host policy. Elapsed time intentionally includes compilation. The runner checks
one aggregate deadline before every target and while each Cargo child is live.
At the deadline it sends TERM, then bounded KILL if needed, to only the process
group and descendant PIDs it launched; it waits until that owned tree is drained
before returning. The timed-out target and terminal run rows both report
`status: "budget_exceeded"`, including whether drain completed, and the PR
profile never launches a later target after the deadline. Exceeding the
effective budget therefore makes the profile fail even when prior assertions
passed. `--self-test` deterministically exercises the passing and timed-out
paths with an internal fake clock and fake process tree; it never invokes
Cargo. This is a scheduling guard, not a benchmark or cross-ISA performance
claim. The runner is a callable lane rather than an additional unconditional
invocation inside the workspace-wide quality script, avoiding duplicate Cargo
work when the full DSR gate already owns package execution.

### Casebook conformance profiles

The structured Casebook surface has a separate repo-local profile runner. It
is intentionally callable rather than activated in DSR or the archived GitHub
workflow specs by this tranche:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh --check
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh --self-test
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh --list pr
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh pr
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh --list nightly-full
bash scripts/ci/casebook_conformance_profile.sh nightly-full
```

The `pr` profile is an explicit reviewed set of cheap, family-representative
Casebook targets. `nightly-full` is complete under its declared discovery
policy: every ordinary Cargo integration-target entrypoint whose Rust tokens
contain an `fs_casebook` import, `extern crate`, or qualified path. Discovery
starts from `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps` and then inspects each reported
test target's canonical source path; target filenames are not a classification
mechanism, so `conformance.rs` and replay targets are not silently missed. The
lexical scanner strips nested comments, cooked/raw/byte strings, and character
literals before classification, so examples or documentation do not create
false coverage. Full coverage auto-adopts every additional discovered target,
while a reviewed minimum inventory prevents accidental target removal or
scanner regression from silently shrinking the lane. The PR set must remain
inside that reviewed baseline and live discovery; duplicate, missing, stale,
malformed, empty, noncanonical-feature, or source-escaping entries fail closed.
Direct and `cfg_attr`-conditional `#[ignore]` markers also refuse discovery:
hardware/performance, weekly, diagnostic, and deep-cap ignored lanes retain
their separately declared cadence and are never swept into `nightly-full` by a
blanket `--ignored`.

That completeness boundary is intentionally exact. The scanner classifies the
Cargo-reported entrypoint, not arbitrary transitive `mod` files, generated macro
output, or a dependency renamed so that no `fs_casebook` token remains. Such a
layout must keep a token in the entrypoint or extend this discovery contract and
its scanner fixtures. This makes an unsupported construction visible rather
than silently claiming semantic whole-program dependency analysis.

`--check` and `--list` invoke only locked Cargo metadata plus source inspection;
they do not build or execute tests. `--self-test` invokes no Cargo command and
creates no temporary files. It exercises the production lexical scanner,
passing and malformed inventories, missing/stale/duplicate classifications,
required-feature selector preservation, pre-launch deadline refusal, spawn and
ordinary failures, stdout/receipt isolation, a leader that leaves a live
descendant, a TERM-resistant timeout requiring KILL, and interruption cleanup.
The default aggregate wall budgets are 900 seconds for `pr` and 7200 seconds
for `nightly-full`; bounded overrides are retained through
`FS_CASEBOOK_PR_BUDGET_SECONDS` and `FS_CASEBOOK_FULL_BUDGET_SECONDS`.

Profile execution runs each selector separately with `--locked`, continues
after ordinary target failures, and stops before launching more work once the
shared monotonic deadline is exhausted. The shell forwards HUP/INT/TERM to its
active wrapper. Each target starts in a new session; its leader remains
unreaped while the wrapper verifies live members by PGID and SID, so PID reuse
cannot redirect cleanup. TERM, a bounded grace period, KILL if needed, and a
bounded drain apply only to that owned group. Child stdout/stderr go to stderr;
stdout is JSONL receipts only. Per-target receipts distinguish ordinary,
spawn, timeout, lingering-descendant, and interrupt outcomes, while the terminal
receipt accounts for emitted and unreported target rows.

Containment does not claim control over adversarial code that deliberately
creates a different session/process group. Receipts state that boundary and
also report provenance as `unsealed`: this helper does not itself bind the
exact HEAD, dirty worktree bytes, lockfile digest, constellation, toolchain,
environment, or ISA. A retained proof must wrap it in the DSR provenance lane.
This remains a scheduling and discovery contract, not benchmark, cross-ISA,
retained-proof, or CI-wiring evidence. Until external DSR configuration
explicitly selects these commands, their existence does not claim that DSR is
already using the PR/full split.

## Runner honesty

- `macos-14` = Apple Silicon (aarch64, NEON): a true reference-family runner.
- The `scripts/ci/x86_cross_check.sh` lane (bead ebro) is the ARM-INVISIBLE
  BREAKAGE firewall: `cargo check --locked --workspace --all-targets --target
  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` from the aarch64 dev machines, followed by one
  derived `cargo check --locked` for every test/bench/bin/example target whose
  manifest declares `required-features`. This covers the default target surface and the
  gated targets that `--all-targets` alone skips. No cross-linker is needed
  (`check` does not link). Each invocation owns a collision-proof log directory
  and a separate Cargo target directory; concurrent proofs never share mutable
  build output.
  Because this is part of the required DSR gate, a missing Rust target is a
  named failure with the installation command, not a zero-exit skip.
  Every Cargo command is lockfile-closed. Its retained JSONL verdict binds the
  exact before/after root content, `constellation.lock`, and every clean pinned
  sibling tree; root or sibling movement fails the lane. The sole terminal row
  says whether that provenance is `sealed` or `incomplete`. It cannot prove
  runtime behavior or generated machine-code quality - real x86 execution still
  lives on the Threadripper lanes.
- The `scripts/ci/x86_runtime_sweep.sh` lane (bead yuyy) closes that runtime
  gap for the pre-release flow: on the first quiet, reachable Threadripper
  (ts1/ts2), fast-forwarded to origin/main, it first runs `cargo run --locked
  -p xtask -- check-identities`, which recomputes and byte-compares the
  committed `identity-schemas.json`, then runs the full workspace tests
  (`--no-fail-fast`). Both commands use the same hermetic target directory,
  their exact statuses are retained, and either failure fails the lane. The
  lane is load-gated with bounded retries (the workers double as rch lanes
  whose background traffic can kill long runs), and dirty/diverged clones are
  refused with a named host diagnostic. Local and remote pre/post dirt
  probes disable global excludes, independently enumerate untracked paths using
  only repository `.gitignore` rules, and reject hidden index flags. Exactly one terminal JSONL
  verdict represents the overall run. The lane never stashes, drops, or
  rewrites remote worktree changes; even `Cargo.lock` churn is a refusal.
  Before Cargo, the remote lane retains a
  `scripts/ci/checkout_constellation.sh --snapshot` identity; after Cargo it
  captures the identity again and requires equality. That binds exact root
  content, `constellation.lock`, and every pinned/clean path-dependency sibling.
  Both Cargo commands run with `--locked`, and a pass requires each exact exit
  status, an
  unchanged before/after HEAD and snapshot, clean post-test remote and local
  worktrees, at least one
  completed suite, no failed suite, and a successfully retained full log. The
  retained marker block includes the final porcelain diagnostic when a test or
  build script dirties the clone. The local caller must itself be clean,
  and the fast-forwarded remote HEAD must equal that admitted local HEAD; a
  remote `origin/main` run can never stand in for uncommitted local changes.
  ~20 min;
  named-skip when no quiet host answers - staleness of the last pass row is
  the alarm to watch. First catch of this class: the obq0 fs-cheb per-ISA
  schedule divergence.
- `ubuntu-24.04` = x86-64, but GitHub-hosted runners do **not** guarantee
  AVX-512. fs-substrate resolves the SIMD tier at startup and the tier is in
  the logs; the x86 lane therefore proves *portable correctness plus whatever
  tier the runner exposes* (typically AVX2). An AVX-512-guaranteed lane needs
  a self-hosted runner and stays **deferred** until one exists. Roofline
  *performance* bands (§14) are meaningless on shared virtual runners and are
  explicitly NOT claimed by CI; they belong to the reference machines with
  ledgered fingerprints.

## xtask policy gates (the `check-all` set)

`cargo run -p xtask -- check-all` runs, and CI treats as one gate:

| Check | What it refuses |
| --- | --- |
| `check-layers` | a crate depending upward/sideways against the L0–L6 map |
| `check-deps` | non-Franken runtime dependencies |
| `check-contracts` | crates missing CONTRACT.md canonical sections |
| `check-unsafe` | unsafe outside registered <300-line capsules with SAFETY.md |
| `check-powi` | optimization-level-dependent `f64::powi` on determinism paths |
| `check-goldens` | golden hashes whose upstream semantic surfaces drifted without a deliberate re-freeze (`golden-couplings.json`, docs/GOLDEN_POLICY.md) |
| `check-identities` | persisted/replayed identity schemas with unclassified source fields, missing exact-field mutations or replay-version refusal guard targets, stale generated coverage, or schema/domain drift without a golden-coupling bump (`identity-schemas.json`) |
| `check-manifest-fixture` | a new-domain package/edge omitted from `proposed-manifest-fixture.json`, an observed undeclared or forbidden edge, a missing declared-present edge, same-layer cycle/order drift, a root/standalone-`fs-wasm` metadata mismatch, or duplicate ownership of a registered domain type |
| `check-claims` | claim-state drift in the tracker mirror |

Each is also runnable alone (same names). Golden re-pins follow
docs/GOLDEN_POLICY.md: committed tree, BOTH build modes, plausible root
cause, coupling row updated in the same commit.

The proposed-manifest gate is deliberately ahead of crate implementation.
Edges marked `present` must resolve now; edges marked `proposed` are reserved
and may be absent until their owner lands, but no other edge may appear. Its
same-layer order and minimal compile-root inventory cover the exact 15-crate
new-domain set, while `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps` observes both the
root workspace and the standalone `crates/fs-wasm` workspace. Every admitted
or rejected edge decision is emitted as a structured JSONL row. The xtask unit
target retains seeded cycle, undeclared-edge, shorthand, and duplicate-type
falsifiers; the real gate remains part of `check-all`, so the configured DSR
quality lane executes it without a separate GitHub workflow.

## Required quality lanes

`scripts/ci/quality_lanes.sh` is a REQUIRED DSR check. It derives every
test, bench, binary, and example target with `required-features` from locked
Cargo metadata and checks/runs each target with its declared features and
`--locked`. The standalone
`crates/fs-wasm` workspace has three required obligations:

1. Native tests against its tracked lock.
2. A locked `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Cargo check.
3. A `wasm-pack build --dev --target web -- --locked` browser build whose
   invocation must not modify the nested lock.

The manifest, `wasm-pack`, and the Rust wasm target are DSR host prerequisites.
Absence is a named FAILURE, not an advisory skip. Every admitted invocation gets
a collision-proof run directory under `target/quality-lanes/` containing full
per-lane logs, an isolated wasm-pack output, `verdicts.jsonl`, and
`inventory.json`; it also owns a separate Cargo target directory. Override paths
are normalized to absolute paths before any nested-workspace command runs. The
inventory SHA-256 hashes canonical input file CONTENTS (manifests, locks, contracts, Rust
sources/tests, CI scripts, and the derived gated-target list), not merely
filenames. The same composite
root + clean-constellation snapshot used by the x86 lane must match before and
after the run.
Per-lane rows and the summary are explicitly `provisional` and carry JSON `null`
for the not-yet-known closing snapshot. The literal final JSONL row is
`quality-proof-seal`; it binds the SHA-256 of every preceding row to the final
snapshot and reports `sealed` or `incomplete`. Consumers MUST verify that seal
rather than treating an earlier row as an independent receipt. Once the run
directory exists, an EXIT finalizer also writes an `incomplete`/`fail` seal for
initial-admission errors and later implicit shell failures; a provisional row
cannot become the terminal record merely because `set -e` fired. SIGKILL,
host/process loss, or a storage failure can still prevent the finalizer from
writing, so a missing or malformed seal is always a failed proof, never a skip.

## Constellation

The workspace path-depends on sibling repos. The canonical fresh-checkout
path is `cargo run --manifest-path tools/bootstrap/Cargo.toml` (beads
huq.17 and 1t8i; docs/BOOTSTRAP.md). This standalone, zero-dependency package
builds before the root workspace resolves, fetches every repo from
`constellation.lock`'s recorded remotes at the pinned revisions, applies the
same pinned-head and clean-tree verification to existing and newly cloned
siblings, and refuses a noncanonical/oversized lock, duplicate or unknown
library, mismatched lock hash, path-unsafe library identity, or missing, wrong,
duplicate, unknown, or type-invalid top-level identity metadata before deriving
or accessing any destination. The canonical v2 lock identity is
`org.frankensim.xtask.constellation-lock.v1` at integer version `1`; its existing
row-only hash still covers `(lib, version, git_head)`. The Rust writer's
retained implementation coupling advances independently under
`org.frankensim.xtask.constellation-lock-writer.v2` at authority version `2`;
that writer epoch is not serialized into the lock and does not expand its
portable identity. The writer fsyncs a uniquely staged same-directory document
before atomic replacement, so a failed write or rename retains the prior valid
lock. Clean verification
disables global ignores, catches files hidden by repository-local excludes,
rejects untracked `.gitignore` authorities plus `assume-unchanged`,
`skip-worktree`, and persisted FSMonitor index authority. Ordinary observations
disable fsmonitor and the untracked cache. The verifier instead reads the raw
primary index: versions 2 and 3 are structurally parsed, any `FSMN` extension is
refused without a per-entry decoding claim, the trailing SHA-1 or SHA-256
checksum is authenticated, and raw Git path grammar is conservatively validated
before any worktree join. Case-insensitive `.git` components, symlink
`.gitmodules`, and every UTF-8 sequence Git documents as HFS-ignored refuse on
all platforms; Windows also refuses native separators, rooted or
drive/stream-qualified paths, and short-name `.git` or symlink `.gitmodules`
aliases. Malformed, truncated, or
checksum-invalid indexes, version 4, split-index `link`, sparse-index `sdir`,
every other unsupported required extension, or ambiguous object-hash/checksum
boundaries fail closed.
A missing primary index is valid only with an empty Git
inventory. This avoids a false clean result when Git refreshes an unavailable
monitor and clears its in-memory fsmonitor-valid bits before `ls-files -f` can
report them. Normalize FSMonitor or split-index state deliberately before
running the gate. Raw tracked file/symlink object IDs are independently
checked with `hash-object --no-filters`, so local filters, EOL transforms, and
working-tree-encoding cannot normalize changed source into a false clean result.
Before raw hashing, every materialized logical index prefix is inspected:
intermediate components must be ordinary directories, and distinct logical
prefixes may not resolve to one filesystem identity on Unix; Windows requires
exact preserved directory-entry spelling and rejects non-symbolic reparse points.
Case/normalization collisions, Unix tracked hard-link aliases, and ancestor-link
redirection therefore refuse before external or collapsed bytes can be admitted.
Every clean-tree
decision also recursively forces initialized nested submodules visible despite
repository or `.gitmodules` ignore policy: at every depth their HEAD must match
the containing index gitlink, their tracked and untracked worktrees must be
clean, and local exclude/index flags cannot conceal changes. This does not
initialize absent submodules or expand `constellation.lock` identity. It supports
only exact ordinary-directory repository roots, strips inherited Git
repository/worktree/index/object redirection, pathspec-mode controls, and
standard-handle and attribute-source overrides; it disables trace destinations
and replacement objects, and isolates global/system configuration, templates,
hooks, attributes, and
credential helpers. Transport admission is default-deny and enables only
`file`, `https`, and `ssh`; `http`, `git`, custom remote helpers, and other
protocols refuse before helper execution. Embedded shell Python runs isolated
from `PYTHONPATH`. Local executable or transport Git authorities, including
remote-VCS helper and bundle/packfile-URI selection, replace
refs, grafts, and `extensions.refStorage` refuse before filter-aware observation
or mutation. `GIT_REFERENCE_BACKEND` is removed alongside inherited object/ref
format defaults. Resume
checkout uses `--no-overwrite-ignore`, preserving owner-controlled ignored
collisions. Fetch disables automatic maintenance and submodule recursion;
checkout also disables submodule recursion, so initialized nested repositories
are verified without outer-bootstrap network or worktree mutation. Recursive
admission reaches every initialized descendant before each parent status forces
gitlink visibility with `--ignore-submodules=none`; a non-content cached diff
independently retains staged-gitlink detection. Provenance
publication stages and fsyncs the candidate first, then
runs two complete whole-constellation revalidation passes plus an exact final
lock-byte check immediately before atomic rename. Every Git subprocess sets
`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1`, so offline or verification paths cannot implicitly fill
missing promisor objects. It supports `--offline` cache verification and `--from`
mirrors, and writes fetch
provenance with identity domain
`org.frankensim.xtask.constellation-bootstrap-provenance.v3` at version `3`
(the top-level schema string remains `frankensim-constellation-bootstrap-v2`);
the standalone and in-workspace producers share one canonical encoder and the
same top-level and row shape,
distinguish the canonical upstream remote from the selected mirror/transport,
record whether that transport was actually used, and stage the complete receipt
beside its destination before atomic replacement. The written and fsynced
staging handle remains live across the final validation barrier. Immediately
before rename, Unix verifies its sealed device/inode, single-link state, and
mutation-sensitive metadata against the visible non-symlink entry; Windows
verifies the corresponding volume serial, file index, link count, attributes,
size, and timestamps without following reparse points. This closes the long
validation-window substitution risk on both platform families. Safe `std`
still exposes only a pathname rename, so the gate makes no claim against the
narrow final identity-check-to-rename race when an untrusted concurrent writer
controls the destination directory. Cooperating concurrent invocations remain
complete and use last-successful-rename-wins ordering. Other targets fail a
support preflight before sibling repository mutation because no safe portable
file-object identity is available. A failed validation or staging write leaves
earlier verified provenance intact; failed temp/rename paths remain
non-authoritative diagnostic artifacts, and parent-directory fsync is
best-effort. `cargo run -p xtask --
bootstrap-constellation` remains the in-workspace command after the sibling
paths already resolve.
`scripts/ci/checkout_constellation.sh` remains the shell-only
equivalent used by the manual workflow specs. It admits the same exact lock
schema/domain/version and refuses malformed identity metadata before any sibling
operation; retained synthetic coverage runs checkout, verify-only, and snapshot
through that parser. Both it and `xtask
check-constellation` now require every sibling to be at the pinned head with a
clean tracked/untracked working tree. The script's `--snapshot` mode is the
canonical repo-local CI content identity. Snapshot v3 length-frames HEAD, index
state, sorted paths, Git-semantic modes, regular-file SHA-256s, symlink target
bytes, explicit missing entries, the exact lock bytes, and every clean pinned
sibling head/tree. Initialized root gitlinks are recursively framed with their
parent index records, actual HEAD, complete nested index/index flags, and exact
worktree bytes; uninitialized gitlinks receive an explicit state marker and are
not initialized. Snapshot traversal applies the same ordinary-prefix and
filesystem-alias barrier before hashing. Thus equal-shape porcelain states with different dirty bytes
or nested indexes cannot collide. Sibling cleanliness probes use the same
recursive boundary semantics and override `ignore=dirty` and `ignore=all`. The
snapshot never hashes rendered `git diff` text and
fails closed on unsupported special files. Cleanliness forces executable-bit and full untracked
reporting, disables global excludes, then independently enumerates untracked
paths using only the repository's `.gitignore` rules; ignored build artifacts
are intentionally outside source identity, but untracked `.gitignore` files are
refused as unpinned policy at the root and every initialized nested repository.
Two complete root-plus-all-siblings captures must match before the digest is
emitted, so adjacent per-repository checks cannot masquerade as one coherent
constellation observation. Raw stage-zero tracked bytes are checked independently
of Git filters, fsmonitor, and the untracked cache. Stable dirty FrankenSim roots are
therefore hashed exactly, while any dirty sibling is refused.

The standalone Rust, shell, and in-workspace xtask bootstrap paths initialize
new siblings in place with a local incomplete-state marker before fetching. A retry may resume
a clean marked checkout, or a clean unborn checkout with the exact expected
origin, without deleting anything. Ordinary dirty repositories and ordinary
repositories at a mismatched HEAD are never repaired automatically. Bumping a
sibling remains deliberate: re-run `cargo run -p xtask -- lock-constellation`
locally and commit the new lock (schema v2 records remotes).

## External DSR wrapper limitations

The repo-local scripts above fail closed and retain their own complete evidence,
but the current DSR wrapper/configuration lives outside this repository and is
not yet an evidence-complete aggregate. As of this revision, external DSR:

- can return success when its repository configuration is missing, malformed,
  unreadable, or resolves to zero checks;
- captures command output in memory and retains only the first 1,000 bytes in
  its result instead of storing a full per-command log;
- does not bind all configured checks to one before/after root + constellation
  snapshot; and
- reports dry-run commands as passed even though they were not executed.

Its separately configured top-level Cargo checks/build also need `--locked`.
Until those external issues are fixed, a bare "DSR 8/8" line is not sufficient
evidence by itself. Cite the exact repo-local `verdicts.jsonl`, full-log paths,
before/after snapshot, HEAD, and lock identities emitted by these scripts. DSR
remains the required orchestrator; this is an explicit no-claim boundary on its
current aggregate receipt, not permission to substitute GitHub Actions.

## Decalogue mapping (plan patch Rev 25)

| Principle | Gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 pure Rust, Franken-only | `xtask check-deps` + `check-unsafe` capsule registry lint | **live** (`ci.yml`) |
| P2 determinism | G5 audit: bit-identical re-run of seeded suites across thread counts | **deferred** — owning bead: determinism audit harness; unit-level determinism asserted in crate suites today |
| P3 differentiable-or-certifiable | gradient-check merge gate (adjoint vs dual/FD; a solver without a passing check cannot merge, §8.7) | **deferred** — wired when fs-ad adjoint infra + first solver land; fs-vskeleton already self-gates its adjoint in-run |
| P4 budgets first | Five-Explicits lint on ledger ops | **live in fs-ledger API** (structured rejection); IR-level admission lint deferred to fs-ir |
| P5 structure preservation | exact-sequence / conservation G0 law suites | **partial** — review-checklist status; suites land with fs-feec |
| P6 roofline-honest | perf-regression bands vs ledgered baselines (§14.4) | **partial** — fs-roofline harness + regress statistics live (fz2.4/fz2.4.1); per-crate `#[ignore]`d perf lanes ledger attainment with anti-collapse floors; TARGET certification requires a quiet reference machine (shared-workbench noise swings axes ±15%+, measured), so gates report targets and assert floors until then |
| P7 cancellation-correct | G4 storm gate (kill/cancel batteries, leak accounting) | **partial** — fs-ledger kill -9 battery runs in `ci.yml` today; executor-wide storms land with fs-exec |
| P8 one data model | conformance suites over shared complex/cochain types | **deferred** — with fs-geom/fs-feec |
| P9 provenance-complete | golden-ledger replay + integrity re-hash; constellation drift + golden-coupling gates | **partial** — integrity, drift, `check-goldens` coupling discipline, and bootstrap fetch-provenance live; replay gate lands with fs-ledger time travel |
| P10 agent-first | JSONL verdicts from every suite retained as artifacts; structured-error schema validation | **partial** — repo-local quality/x86 verdict and full-log retention live; external DSR aggregation limitations are named above; catalog no-drift gate lands with fs-ir |

## Gate meta-tests (are the gates real?)

`ci-self-test.yml` proves the wiring by injection:

1. `FS_CI_INJECT_FAILURE=1` arms a deliberately failing xtask test → the test
   gate must go red (asserted by inverting the step's exit code).
2. A seeded formatting violation → `cargo fmt --check` must go red.
3. The xtask unit battery seeds layer/dependency/contract/unsafe violations
   and asserts each is caught (`cargo test -p xtask -- seeded`).

A green `ci-self-test` run is the evidence that a red gate blocks; run it
after any change to the workflows or to xtask's checks.

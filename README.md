FrankenSim is a working Rust workspace for deterministic geometry, certified numerics, meshing, execution, evidence, and design-ledger infrastructure for simulation and design optimization.

The tree contains a real Cargo workspace with 73 `fs-*` crates, repository policy tooling, conformance contracts, integration tests, and working implementations across substrate/runtime, numerical kernels, geometry representations, meshing, physics, solvers, adjoints, optimization, imaging, evidence, packaging, and ledger layers.

There is not yet a packaged end-user simulation application or crates.io release. Today, FrankenSim is usable as a source workspace and library substrate.

## TL;DR

**The problem:** simulation systems often split physical units, numerical error, runtime behavior, geometry validity, evidence, and reproducibility across separate tools. That makes it too easy for an optimization run to produce an answer without a durable explanation of which assumptions, approximations, kernels, and machine conditions made the answer valid.

**The solution:** FrankenSim builds those concerns into the workspace architecture. Units are represented explicitly, kernels have deterministic contracts, geometry conversions carry evidence, runtime behavior is structured around cancellable work contexts, and the ledger records artifacts, operations, events, roofline measurements, and time-travelable design state.

### What Exists Now

## Quick Start

FrankenSim currently builds from source. The workspace expects sibling Franken projects for path dependencies, especially `~/projects/asupersync` and `~/projects/frankensqlite`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim.git
cd frankensim

# Use the pinned nightly toolchain from rust-toolchain.toml.
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rustfmt clippy --toolchain nightly

# Build and test the workspace.
cargo test --workspace
```

Run the repository policy checks:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- check-all
```

Run the project validation lane through DSR, which is the preferred verification path for this repo:

```bash
DSR_BIN="$(command -v dsr || printf '%s' /Users/jemanuel/projects/doodlestein_self_releaser/dsr)"
"$DSR_BIN" repos info frankensim
"$DSR_BIN" quality --tool frankensim
```

GitHub Actions is not the source of truth for this project. Use DSR for automation and verification.

## Examples

These examples are library-level examples. FrankenSim does not yet expose a stable end-user CLI.

### Deterministic Sparse Assembly

```rust
use fs_sparse::{Coo, Csr};

let mut coo = Coo::new(3, 3);
coo.push(0, 0, 2.0);
coo.push(0, 1, -1.0);
coo.push(1, 0, -1.0);
coo.push(1, 1, 2.0);
coo.push(1, 2, -1.0);
coo.push(2, 1, -1.0);
coo.push(2, 2, 2.0);

let csr: Csr = coo.assemble();
let mut y = vec![0.0; 3];
csr.spmv(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], &mut y);
assert_eq!(y, vec![0.0, 0.0, 4.0]);
```

### Chebyshev Collocation and Stability Probes

```rust
use fs_cheb::orr_sommerfeld::{critical_reynolds, max_growth};

let growth = max_growth(5772.0, 1.02, 48).expect("eigen solve");
let critical = critical_reynolds(1.02, 48, 4000.0, 8000.0).expect("bracketed solve");

assert!(growth.is_finite());
assert!(critical > 5000.0);
```

### Evidence-Carrying Values

```rust
use fs_evidence::{Evidence, ProvenanceHash};

let provenance = ProvenanceHash::of_bytes(b"example kernel output");
let value = Evidence::exact(42.0, provenance)
    .certified()
    .expect("exact pure-math evidence is certifiable");

assert_eq!(value.value, 42.0);
```

### Evidence Packages and Standalone Checking

```rust
use fs_checker::check_against_root;
use fs_evidence::{Color, ValidityDomain};
use fs_package::{Claim, EvidencePackage, Provenance};

let regime = ValidityDomain::unconstrained().with("Re", 100_000.0, 300_000.0);
let claim = Claim::new(
    "lift-window",
    "lift coefficient was validated against the wind-tunnel fixture",
    Color::Validated {
        regime,
        dataset: "wt-2026-a".to_string(),
    },
);

let pkg = EvidencePackage::new(Provenance::new("commit-abc", "lock-def"))
    .with_claim(claim)
    .signed("ed25519:detached-signature-placeholder");

let root = pkg.merkle_root();
let report = check_against_root(&pkg, root);

assert!(report.passed());
assert_eq!(report.merkle_root, root);
assert!(report.render_pie().contains("validated"));
```

### Repository Policy Checks

`xtask` is part of the workspace and emits JSON-lines verdicts so agents and DSR can parse results without scraping prose.

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- check-layers
cargo run -p xtask -- check-deps
cargo run -p xtask -- check-contracts
cargo run -p xtask -- check-unsafe
cargo run -p xtask -- check-all
cargo run -p xtask -- check-constellation
```

## Architecture

The implemented crates follow a layered architecture. Lower layers do not depend on higher layers; `xtask check-layers` enforces that direction.

                              |
                 fs-qty   fs-obs   fs-evidence
```

The diagram is simplified: some crates are siblings rather than strict parents, and `fs-qty`, `fs-obs`, and `fs-evidence` provide cross-cutting utility contracts. The authoritative dependency rule is the layer metadata in each crate manifest plus `xtask check-layers`.

## Design Principles

### Determinism Is a Contract

FrankenSim treats determinism as something each crate must state. Crate contracts identify determinism class, cancellation behavior, unsafe boundaries, and no-claim boundaries. The goal is not to pretend every floating-point path is identical on every machine; it is to say exactly what is stable, what is measured, and what evidence travels with a result.

### Evidence Travels With Results

The workspace uses explicit evidence wrappers instead of leaving proof obligations in comments. `fs-evidence` provides numerical, statistical, and model-form evidence; geometry conversion crates and ledger code can carry these records forward instead of discarding them at API boundaries.

### Geometry Is Representation-Aware

`fs-geom` defines chart and region contracts, while SDF, mesh, and F-rep crates implement specific representation behavior. This lets conversion, meshing, and transformation code reason about representation validity instead of treating geometry as an opaque blob.

### Runtime Behavior Is Inspectable

Execution contexts, cancellation gates, stream keys, tile pools, event schemas, and roofline measurement are regular workspace concepts. Long-running kernels are expected to be cancellable, observable, and attributable to ledgered artifacts and machine fingerprints.

### Repository Policy Is Code

The repo does not rely on prose alone for architecture rules. `xtask` enforces layer direction, dependency policy, contract presence, unsafe-capsule registration, and constellation lock consistency.

## Implemented Algorithms and Mechanics

The important point is not just that the crate names exist. The workspace already contains concrete algorithms and data structures with tests and contracts around them.

| Area | Implemented mechanics |
|------|-----------------------|
| Sparse assembly | `fs_sparse::Coo` stages triplets, canonicalizes them with deterministic duplicate accumulation, and emits CSR. CSR, BSR, and SELL kernels accumulate rows in a fixed column order so cross-format SpMV behavior is testable. |
| Randomized NLA | `fs-la::rand_nla` provides seeded range finding, randomized SVD, Nyström PSD approximation, sketch-and-precondition least squares, Hutchinson trace estimation, and Hutch++ trace estimation. Its golden-hash sentinel is still proof-pending. |
| Certified arithmetic | `fs-ivl` provides outward-rounded intervals, affine arithmetic, Taylor models, Newton/Krawczyk helpers, expansions, and exact predicates for orientation and in-sphere/incircle decisions. |
| Spectral numerics | `fs-cheb` implements adaptive 1D Chebyshev expansions, Lobatto grids, differentiation matrices, Dirichlet Laplacian checks, and an Orr-Sommerfeld stability battery. |
| Randomness and sampling | `fs-rand` uses counter-based Philox streams keyed by logical identity, with Sobol/QMC and lattice helpers so replay does not depend on thread arrival order. |
| AD and adjoints | `fs-ad` includes forward-mode dual numbers, a `Real` scalar contract, gradient checking, implicit-function hooks, and checkpointed/full-adjoint scaffolding. |
| Anytime inference | `fs-eproc` implements betting e-processes, pairwise races, Gaussian mixture confidence sequences, and e-BH support for conservative stopping decisions. |
| Geometry representations | `fs-geom` defines chart/region contracts; SDF, mesh, and F-rep crates implement concrete chart families, conversion records, quality checks, and representation-specific query behavior. |
| Transformations | `fs-xform` implements FFD lattices, RBF morphs, velocity bands, density fields, composed parameterizations, Jacobian actions, and foldover detection. |
| Meshing | `fs-mesh` contains tetrahedralization/refinement scaffolding, exact audits, ghost/refinement helpers, metric fields, remeshing, and execution-aware hooks. |
| Imaging | `fs-img` contains deterministic image artifact plumbing for the LUMEN layer: PNG/OpenEXR subset handling, film/display transforms, and explicitly bias-labeled denoising. |
| Execution | `fs-exec` provides cancellation contexts, stream keys, tile kernels, tile pools, deterministic reductions, racing/tuning scaffolding, solver state, and kill registries over `asupersync`. |
| Ledger | `fs-ledger` records content-addressed artifacts, operations, events, metrics, tune rows, extension rows, integrity checks, lineage, and time-travel queries on FrankenSQLite. |
| Roofline | `fs-roofline` probes machine axes, registers measurable kernels, records runs to the ledger, and checks staleness against machine fingerprints. |

## Why This Is Useful

FrankenSim is not trying to be another wrapper around an external solver. The useful part is that the same workspace owns the path from representation to evidence. A result can carry dimensional meaning, numerical method, solver status, derivative provenance, validity regime, machine fingerprint, and package-level audit data without crossing an untyped boundary.

| Common failure mode | FrankenSim's implemented answer |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| A quantity loses units once it enters a kernel | `fs-qty`, `fs-scenario`, and `fs-opt` keep dimensional information explicit at API boundaries |
| A geometry conversion silently changes validity | `fs-geom`, representation crates, `fs-query`, and `fs-topo` expose chart contracts, conversion records, and validity/topology checks |
| A solve returns a number but not a reason to trust it | `fs-solver`, `fs-adjoint`, `fs-verify`, and `fs-evidence` return residuals, certificates, brackets, validation domains, and evidence colors |
| An optimizer stalls and nobody knows why | `fs-ascent`, `fs-dfo`, and `fs-constraint` report stop reasons, KKT residuals, unsat cores, repair suggestions, and restart schedules |
| A benchmark only works on one machine | `fs-substrate`, `fs-roofline`, `fs-ledger`, and DSR make machine axes, kernels, measurements, and validation lanes explicit |
| An auditor wants the evidence, not the solver | `fs-package`, `fs-checker`, and `fs-crosswalk` package claims, re-check them without the solver stack, and describe them in existing certification vocabulary |

The design target is a workflow where "what did we compute?" and "why should anyone believe it?" are not separate artifacts.

## End-to-End Flow

The crates are deliberately small, but the intended flow is continuous. A design study can move from typed intent to geometry, physics, derivatives, optimization, and audit without dropping provenance.

```text
typed intent / study IR
        |
        v
fs-ir, fs-opt, fs-scenario
        |
        v
geometry and representation layer
fs-geom -> fs-rep-sdf / fs-rep-mesh / fs-rep-nurbs / fs-rep-voxel / fs-rep-frep
        |
        v
validity, queries, topology, and meshing
fs-query -> fs-topo -> fs-mesh -> fs-feec / fs-cutfem / fs-solid
        |
        v
operators and solves
fs-opdsl / fs-tilelang -> fs-sparse / fs-la -> fs-solver
        |
        v
derivatives and optimization
fs-ad / fs-adjoint -> fs-ascent / fs-dfo / fs-constraint
        |
        v
evidence, replay, and audit
fs-evidence -> fs-ledger -> fs-package -> fs-checker -> fs-crosswalk
```

That flow is still library-level rather than an end-user app, but the important seams already exist in code: geometry knows its chart, physics has typed scenarios and solver reports, adjoints are checked against finite differences, optimizers return certificates, and evidence packages can be verified without running the solver.

## Algorithmic Spine

### Geometry and Topology

FrankenSim uses representation-specific charts instead of flattening all geometry into one mesh too early. SDF grids, triangle/tet meshes, rational NURBS patches, voxel fields, point clouds, lattices, and F-reps each keep their own query and validity contracts. Conversion is treated as an operation with a record, not as a silent cast.

Important mechanics already implemented include exact rational spline refinement in `fs-rep-nurbs`, sparse VDB-style fields and exact Euclidean distance transforms in `fs-rep-voxel`, mesh repair and winding support in `fs-rep-mesh`, CSG/F-rep evaluation in `fs-rep-frep`, and topology/validity checks in `fs-topo`.

### Discretization and Physics

The FLUX layer is built around discrete exterior calculus and explicit weak forms. `fs-feec` owns cochains, incidence, Hodge stars, high-order FEEC spaces, Betti checks, and Hodge decomposition. `fs-cutfem` works directly on certified SDF cuts with ghost penalty, Nitsche embedded boundary conditions, and cut quadrature. `fs-solid` provides small-strain and finite-strain elasticity, B-bar locking relief, CutFEM/body-fitted frontends, and Newton globalization against constitutive laws from `fs-material`.

The principle is that numerical stabilization should either follow from the complex/operator structure or be recorded as a named method with tests. Spurious modes, checkerboarding, cut-cell conditioning, locking, and buckling-adjacent tangents are treated as design constraints rather than after-the-fact patches.

### Solvers, Adjoints, and Optimization

The solver stack is resumable and transposition-aware. `fs-solver` implements CG, MINRES, GMRES, matrix-free operators, mixed-precision refinement, and p-multigrid with deterministic reductions. `fs-adjoint` builds gradients by transposed solves and IFT machinery rather than differentiating through Krylov iterations. The feature-gated ledger-transposition module records a DAG and pulls cotangents backward through registered VJPs, refusing missing or declared non-differentiable seams loudly instead of returning a silent zero.

On top of that, `fs-ascent` provides L-BFGS with strong-Wolfe search, trust-region Newton-Krylov with Steihaug negative-curvature handling, augmented-Lagrangian constraints with KKT certificates, Riemannian L-BFGS over manifold metadata, and a stop-rule algebra that attributes why a run ended. `fs-dfo` adds deterministic CMA-ES, BIPOP restarts, and Nelder-Mead for cases where gradients are unavailable or untrusted.

### Evidence, Packages, and Standards

`fs-evidence` gives values a claim type. `fs-package` groups color-typed claims and provenance into a content-addressed Merkle bundle. `fs-checker` re-verifies package completeness, content address, signature presence, and budget breakdown without depending on solvers, geometry, or license gates. `fs-crosswalk` maps the same package concepts onto ASME V&V 10/20/40 and FAA/EASA certification-by-analysis vocabulary.

That division matters: the expensive solver can produce evidence once, while a reviewer can later check the package structure and provenance without re-running the solver stack.

## Design Rules Encoded In The Code

The README-level principles are backed by concrete implementation patterns:

| Rule | Where it shows up |
|------|-------------------|
| Make invalid states loud | Typed `Error`/refusal enums in geometry, packages, constraints, solvers, and scenarios; missing VJPs and non-differentiable seams block gradients |
| Keep replay independent of arrival order | Philox stream keys, deterministic reductions, sorted assembly, fixed traversal order, and content-addressed artifacts |
| Put budgets in data | Stop rules, solver iteration reports, cut quadrature depth, roofline runs, package color breakdowns, and session resource estimates |
| Separate production code from oracle code | Franken-only runtime dependency policy plus isolated test/oracle paths checked by `xtask` |
| Prefer certificates to comments | `CONTRACT.md` files, `fs-evidence`, gradient verification gates, package checks, topology checks, and ledger receipts |
| Treat performance as a measured claim | `fs-roofline`, substrate machine fingerprints, tune rows, and DSR validation lanes |
| Avoid hidden global state | Explicit contexts, stream keys, scenarios, manifests, packages, and ledger records |

## Evidence Package Lifecycle

The evidence-package crates are small, but they define an important workflow:

1. A solver, verifier, optimizer, or study runner creates claims with evidence colors: verified, validated, or estimated.
2. `fs-package` bundles those claims with provenance and a deterministic content address.
3. `fs-checker` re-verifies the bundle's structural completeness, expected root, signature presence, and budget pie without pulling in the solver stack.
4. `fs-crosswalk` gives the package a standards-facing vocabulary so the same artifact can be discussed as validation metrics, domain of validation, provenance, certified bounds, and content integrity.
5. `fs-ledger` can retain artifacts, operations, events, tune rows, roofline measurements, and lineage so a later report can connect package claims back to the actual run history.

This is why the package/checker/crosswalk layer is useful even before FrankenSim has a polished application: it turns internal numerical claims into an inspectable artifact boundary.

## Reading Paths

Different readers should start in different places.

| Goal | Start here |
|------|------------|
| Understand the architecture | `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md`, then this README's architecture and crate-map sections |
| Check repository policy | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CI_GATES.md`, `xtask`, and `constellation.lock` |
| Study numerical kernels | `crates/fs-math`, `crates/fs-la`, `crates/fs-sparse`, `crates/fs-fft`, `crates/fs-ivl`, `crates/fs-cheb` |
| Study geometry | `crates/fs-geom`, `crates/fs-rep-*`, `crates/fs-query`, `crates/fs-topo`, `crates/fs-mesh` |
| Study physics and solvers | `crates/fs-feec`, `crates/fs-cutfem`, `crates/fs-solid`, `crates/fs-material`, `crates/fs-solver` |
| Study gradients and optimization | `crates/fs-ad`, `crates/fs-adjoint`, `crates/fs-ascent`, `crates/fs-dfo`, `crates/fs-constraint` |
| Study audit and packaging | `crates/fs-evidence`, `crates/fs-ledger`, `crates/fs-package`, `crates/fs-checker`, `crates/fs-crosswalk` |

## Contracts and Verification

The workspace currently has 73 `CONTRACT.md` files for 73 `fs-*` crates.

Existing contracts use these required sections:

- purpose and layer
- public types and semantics
- invariants
- error model
- determinism class
- cancellation behavior
- unsafe boundary
- feature flags
- conformance tests
- no-claim boundaries

Use these commands for local checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p xtask -- check-all
```

Use DSR for the project validation path:

```bash
DSR_BIN="$(command -v dsr || printf '%s' /Users/jemanuel/projects/doodlestein_self_releaser/dsr)"
"$DSR_BIN" repos info frankensim
"$DSR_BIN" quality --tool frankensim
```

The current DSR setup is preferred over GitHub Actions for this repository. If a future GitHub workflow appears, do not treat it as authoritative unless `AGENTS.md` and DSR policy are changed first.

## How FrankenSim Compares

| Capability | FrankenSim today | Mature solver stacks | General scientific Python |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| End-user simulation app | Not yet | Yes, depending on stack | Usually assembled by user |
| Library substrate | Yes, source workspace | Yes | Yes |
| Determinism and cancellation contracts | Explicit crate contracts | Varies by project | Varies by package |
| Evidence-carrying values | Implemented core wrappers | Usually external/ad hoc | Usually external/ad hoc |
| Geometry representation contracts | Implemented SDF/mesh/NURBS/voxel/F-rep chart layer | Often specialized | Usually library-specific |
| Design ledger | Implemented FrankenSQLite-backed crate | Often separate tooling | Usually separate notebooks/files |
| Roofline measurement | Implemented harness crate | Varies | Usually external tooling |
| Packaged distribution | Not yet | Often yes | Yes |

Use FrankenSim today when you want to work inside a deterministic, evidence-oriented Rust substrate for simulation infrastructure. Use a mature solver stack when you need a ready-made production physics solver or GUI today.

## Troubleshooting

### `failed to load source for dependency asupersync`

FrankenSim uses local path dependencies for the Franken constellation. Keep sibling repositories next to this checkout:

```text
~/projects/frankensim
~/projects/asupersync
~/projects/frankensqlite
```

Then rerun:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### `the option Z is only accepted on the nightly compiler`

Use the pinned nightly toolchain:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rustfmt clippy --toolchain nightly
cargo +nightly test --workspace
```

### `xtask check-deps` rejects a dependency

Runtime dependencies are intentionally restricted to the Franken constellation and workspace crates. Dev-only oracle dependencies may be allowed in test scope, but runtime additions need an architecture decision and matching contract update.

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- check-deps
```

### `xtask check-contracts` fails

Every `fs-*` crate must ship a `CONTRACT.md` with the required sections. If this check fails, either a new crate was added without a contract or an existing contract lost one of the required sections. Use an existing crate contract as the local template and keep the no-claim boundaries honest.

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- check-contracts
```

### DSR and local commands disagree

Treat DSR as the project automation source of truth. Local commands are useful for fast iteration; DSR is the lane to cite when reporting repository health.

```bash
DSR_BIN="$(command -v dsr || printf '%s' /Users/jemanuel/projects/doodlestein_self_releaser/dsr)"
"$DSR_BIN" quality --tool frankensim
```

## Limitations

FrankenSim has substantial working code, but it is still early infrastructure.

| Capability | Current state |
|------------|---------------|
| Stable public API | Not promised yet; contracts exist, but APIs may still change |
| End-user CLI/application | Not implemented as a packaged simulation app |
| crates.io distribution | Not published |
| GitHub Actions | Not authoritative for this repo; use DSR |
| Full multiphysics solver suite | Not complete in the current workspace |
| Neural representations | Not implemented as a first-class representation crate in the current workspace |
| Randomized NLA golden sentinel | `fs-la::rand_nla` is implemented and mostly covered, but `rand_nla_golden_hash` still carries a placeholder hash until the observed value is deliberately recorded and cross-ISA proof is completed |
| Ascent golden sentinel | `fs-ascent` implements the optimizer stack, but its trajectory golden hash lane still needs the recorded hash to be frozen in the test source |
| Long-running stability fixtures | Some structural stability and snap-through tests are active proof lanes and may need targeted runtime/threshold work rather than being treated as cheap smoke tests |
| Production validation corpus | In progress through contracts, tests, ledger records, and roofline harnesses |
| Performance claims | Must be backed by `fs-roofline`/ledger evidence; do not infer claims from architecture text alone |

The long-form architecture reference remains in `COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_FRANKENSIM.md`, but this README describes the code that is already present in the repository.

## FAQ

### Is FrankenSim usable today?

Yes, as a Rust source workspace and simulation-infrastructure library substrate. It is not yet a polished end-user simulator.

### What should I run first?

Start with the workspace tests and policy checks:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p xtask -- check-all
```

For the project validation lane, use:

```bash
DSR_BIN="$(command -v dsr || printf '%s' /Users/jemanuel/projects/doodlestein_self_releaser/dsr)"
"$DSR_BIN" quality --tool frankensim
```

### Why nightly Rust?

The repository pins nightly in `rust-toolchain.toml` for Rust 2024 plus narrow nightly features documented in the repo, including const-generic dimension arithmetic and optional portable-SIMD experiments. Most code is written so future de-nightlying should be localized rather than a rewrite.

### Why are local Franken dependencies required?

The workspace intentionally depends on other Franken projects by path for runtime pieces such as `asupersync` and `frankensqlite`. `xtask check-constellation` and `constellation.lock` make that relationship explicit.

### Are the crate contracts normative?

Yes. Existing `CONTRACT.md` files are part of how the workspace communicates implemented behavior. If code and contract disagree, that is a bug to resolve, not a documentation detail to ignore.

### Should I use GitHub Actions?

No. Use DSR for this repository unless the repository policy changes. GitHub Actions may be absent, stale, or non-authoritative.

## About Contributions

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Codex or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

# Changelog

This is a synthesized, agent-facing changelog for FrankenSim.

Scope window: historical reconstruction from project inception on 2026-07-05 through
[`main@291c7db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/291c7dbfdc6fd366f6ee55a6dbc39f137e05afd6)
on 2026-07-10.

The unreleased documentation entry below is intentionally narrower. It records
the verified workspace and capability-maturity facts at
[`main@55379ba`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/55379baf41cf1d3584c87a81ae1dde20508a4c8f)
on 2026-07-22; it is not a claim that all 1,676 intervening commits have already
been reconstructed into capability waves here.

This document was rebuilt from git history, tag/release metadata, the checked-in
Beads tracker, and the committed README/contract surface at each endpoint. It
is organized by landed capabilities rather than raw diff order.

## Unreleased — Documentation Truth Refresh (2026-07-22)

This small-scope update reconciles the public README with the current tree and
the new machine-readable maturity registry. Its evidence sources are the root
workspace manifest, the live `crates/` inventory, crate test and contract paths,
[`capability-maturity.json`](capability-maturity.json),
[`docs/MATURITY_LEVELS.md`](docs/MATURITY_LEVELS.md), and the checked-in Beads
workstream.

### Delivered documentation correction

- Corrected the workspace inventory from 126 native `fs-*` members plus
  standalone `fs-wasm` to 135 native members plus `fs-wasm`: 136 `fs-*` crate
  directories in total.
- Corrected contract coverage from 127/127 to 136/136 and the tracked crate
  integration-test inventory from 276 to 509. The README now says explicitly that a
  file count is not a green-suite claim.
- Added the registry-backed capability boundary: 14 registered capabilities,
  with 10 at L2 and 4 at L1; none is registered at L3, L4, or L5.
- Documented the registry's current lowest-tier caveat: an L1 entry can still
  carry an operative note that the capability is unbuilt or temporarily
  build-broken, so the level label alone is not a green-build assertion.
- Replaced stale prose saying neural representations were absent and external
  validation was merely "in progress." The README now records that
  `fs-rep-neural` exists but has no registered maturity claim, while an external
  production validation corpus does not yet exist.
- Qualified design-ledger and browser-flagship prose with their recorded L1
  status and known failing/build-broken boundaries instead of presenting crate
  presence as integrated capability proof.
- Added generated README repository facts and a generated capability matrix,
  both enforced by the named `xtask check-docs` gate and composed into
  `xtask check-all`.
- Added [`doc-facts-inventory.json`](doc-facts-inventory.json), a portable
  tracked-input registry that is checked exactly against `git ls-files` in a
  worktree and remains usable in RCH/archive snapshots where `.git` is
  intentionally absent. This keeps untracked working-tree files out of public
  counts without making remote verification depend on transferred Git internals.

### Active workstream

- [`frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.16.6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/blob/55379baf41cf1d3584c87a81ae1dde20508a4c8f/.beads/issues.jsonl)
  tracks the wider documentation-truth program. The implementation now covers
  the visible narrative, generated facts, the registry-backed capability
  matrix, a seeded stale-count regression, and `xtask check-all` composition;
  its final proof and tracker closeout are recorded on the Bead rather than
  overstated here as a repository-wide green-suite claim.

### Representative commit

- [`55379ba`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/55379baf41cf1d3584c87a81ae1dde20508a4c8f)
  — add the capability-maturity registry and governed promotion events that
  supply the README's current evidence boundary.

### Post-checkpoint validation-corpus authority slice

- Added a versioned, canonical `fs-vvreg` corpus schema covering retained
  payload identity, sensors and uncertainty, geometry, environment, dataset
  partition, preprocessing lineage, context of use, license, provenance,
  retention, acceptance regimes, and A-E evidence levels.
- Added exact-partition and dimensioned context query gates. Successful seeded
  queries deliberately return numerical `NoClaim`; caller-built registries
  cannot acquire query authority.
- Registered two worked rows: an explicitly synthetic Level-B CHT fixture and
  the existing Martin-Moyce 1952 digitized square-column curve as a Level-C
  retained artifact.
- Preserved the Martin-Moyce row's evidentiary gaps instead of fabricating
  metadata: original raw records, instrument/calibration/placement authority,
  acquisition environment/date, digitization replay, redistribution authority,
  and a defensible scalar envelope are recorded as unavailable or unresolved.
  Those gaps force the physical support cap to `Estimated`.
- Added deterministic audit output that reports optional omissions and
  reason-bearing claim-authority gaps as `WARN`, while structural defects remain
  `ERROR` failures.
- This registry slice does not establish a production validation corpus or an
  L4 capability. It records what bytes and metadata exist, and makes the
  no-claim boundary executable.
- Added a retained Level-A thermal manifest with 19 versioned rows: 12
  independently recomputed analytic references across conduction, fin,
  transient, convection-limit, radiation, and contact families, plus seven G1
  primal/adjoint order targets covering P1/P2, Neumann/Robin, and nonlinear
  anisotropic cases.
- Every Level-A row is explicitly reference-only or target-only. Registry
  queries remain numerical `NoClaim`; no solver output, mesh/refinement ladder,
  adjoint run, or machine fingerprint is bound yet, so registration is not
  reported as a G1 pass.

### Post-checkpoint Level-A execution crosswalk

- Bound six canonical Level-A analytic rows directly into the executing
  `fs-conduction` fixtures: two slab fluxes, uniform-source center rise,
  rectangular affine temperature, cylindrical-shell conductance, and `mL=1`
  adiabatic-tip fin efficiency.
- Bound three canonical P1 MMS rows directly into their executing L2 ladders:
  isotropic Dirichlet, mixed Neumann, and Robin. The tests now take the
  theoretical slope and order-gate tolerance from `fs-vvreg` instead of
  repeating those target values locally.
- Added complete analytic and MMS crosswalks. The ten unexecuted rows retain
  specific gaps: missing spherical/transient/radiation/contact physics,
  convection ownership, P2 elements, a combined anisotropic nonlinear case,
  and dual-order ladders.
- Kept authority boundaries explicit. These are test-time execution bindings,
  not retained corpus receipts; solver/model envelopes remain separate from
  the catalog's formula-reproduction tolerances, no ladder or machine
  fingerprint is persisted, and `fs-vvreg` queries remain numerical
  `NoClaim` with physical support capped at `Estimated`.
- Proved the bound battery remotely at stable HEAD `bff2be3f` with
  `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --no-self-healing -- env
  CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${RCH_TARGET_BASE:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}}/rch_target_frankensim_test"
  cargo test -p fs-conduction --all-targets`: 39/39 tests passed (2 adjoint,
  7 analytic, 22 conformance, 8 MMS) on `vmi1227854`, RCH job
  `29943194691043348`. Cargo execution took 193.346 seconds after the
  dependency transfer; the run produced no `fs-conduction` warning.

### Post-checkpoint Level-A convection execution crosswalk

- Bound the two `fs-vvreg` `ConvectionLimit` rows directly into the executing
  `fs-convection` circular-duct limiting-case test. The 3.66 constant-wall-
  temperature and 4.36 constant-heat-flux results now use the registry values,
  context, metric, and tolerance instead of duplicate local reference literals.
- Added a complete two-row family partition check and JSON comparison verdicts
  carrying the computed value, reference, absolute error, envelope, and
  `executed-formula-limit-not-registry-receipt` authority label.
- Raised aggregate Level-A execution coverage from 9/19 to 11/19. Eight gaps
  remain: spherical conduction, lumped transient conduction, radiation,
  contact resistance, P2 primal, combined anisotropic-nonlinear MMS, and the
  P1/P2 adjoint-order ladders. No retained comparison receipt or machine
  fingerprint is added, so registry authority remains `NoClaim`/`Estimated`.
- Remote proof passed all 11 `fs-convection` targets tests with
  `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --no-self-healing -- env
  CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${RCH_TARGET_BASE:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}}/rch_target_frankensim_test"
  cargo test -p fs-convection --all-targets` on worker `vmi1149989`, job
  `j-29943194691043354`. The shared HEAD advanced from `d8c2c422` to
  `877790ab` during the lane without touching these owned files, so this is a
  passing dirty-worktree proof, not a same-HEAD receipt.

### Post-checkpoint Level-A spherical-shell execution binding

- Added a deterministic pole-free spherical-shell patch to `fs-conduction`.
  The radial faces carry catalog-derived Dirichlet data; the conical and
  azimuthal faces are adiabatic for the radial `1/r` solution, avoiding pole
  and seam degeneracy while still exercising the 3-D conduction assembly.
- Bound `thermal-a-sphere-shell` directly into the analytic solver battery.
  The test checks second-order L2 refinement, a separate nodal envelope, and
  heat-rate convergence after normalizing the patch by its analytic solid
  angle. The focused remote probe observed a `3.962` L2 refinement ratio,
  `0.005565 K` fine L2 error, `0.5942 K` fine nodal error, and `0.373%`
  full-shell conductance error.
- Raised aggregate Level-A execution coverage from 11/19 to 12/19. Seven gaps
  remain: lumped transient conduction, radiation, contact resistance, P2
  primal, combined anisotropic-nonlinear MMS, and the P1/P2 adjoint-order
  ladders. This adds no retained comparison receipt or machine fingerprint;
  registry authority remains `NoClaim`/`Estimated`.
- Remote proof passed with
  `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --no-self-healing -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="${RCH_TARGET_BASE:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}}/rch_target_frankensim_test" cargo test -p fs-conduction --all-targets`:
  40/40 tests (`2` adjoint, `8` analytic, `22` conformance, `8` MMS) on worker
  `vmi1227854`, job `j-29943194691043361` (614.2 seconds total; 356.1 sync,
  189.3 remote command, 2.1 artifact retrieval). Shared `main` advanced from
  `22f2ab44` to `6a63d601` during the lane without touching these reserved
  files, so this is passing dirty-worktree evidence, not a same-HEAD receipt.

### Post-checkpoint convection-correlation rung

- Added `fs-convection`, an L3 library with 11 Nusselt relations spanning
  analytic duct limits, developing and turbulent ducts, rectangular ducts,
  flat plates, isolated-cylinder crossflow, and vertical-plate natural
  convection.
- Each relation carries a source, assumptions, known failures, a shared
  machine-readable validity domain, and an explicit discrepancy basis.
  Missing, non-finite, non-positive, or out-of-domain inputs refuse instead of
  extrapolating silently.
- The public dimensional conversion returns typed W/(m² K) with attached model
  evidence. The paired Robin-boundary adapter keeps that evidence beside the
  exact boundary row consumed by `fs-conduction`.
- Added Level-A limit and frozen-formula spot checks, domain-edge refusals, a G3
  coherent-unit-rescaling check, evidence-retention checks, and a
  three-flow-rate conduction seam test. The focused remote Cargo lane passed 10
  tests.
- The empirical discrepancy values are declared engineering allowances, not
  source-published confidence intervals. Source-table corpora, automatic model
  selection or blending, interrupted-fin and array-interference models,
  conjugate CFD, experimental validation, and capability-maturity registration
  remain outside this slice.

### Post-checkpoint fan/network operating-point rung

- Added `fs-airflow`, an L3 library for typed, monotone fan curves and
  series/parallel quadratic-loss networks. Admission makes pressure tolerance,
  tolerance authority, speed-scaling bounds, and the non-admissible stall
  region explicit; malformed or out-of-domain inputs refuse structurally.
- Added identical-fan series/parallel laws, exact quadratic resistance
  composition, and an enclosure model that requires leakage to be represented
  as a distinct branch rather than buried in a fitted system coefficient.
- Added a bounded interval-Newton solve for the unique nominal intersection of
  the retained fan and system curves. Only that declared mathematical root is
  `Certified`; fan-data tolerance, loss uncertainty, model discrepancy,
  pressure, branch flow, and leakage conclusions remain `Estimate` evidence.
- Added deterministic terminal-branch allocation and a typed velocity/Reynolds
  handoff into `fs-convection`, retaining the weakest evidence authority and
  refusing missing branches or invalid handoff quantities. Operating-point
  provenance binds the full curve, source and tolerance authority, fan-bank
  configuration, recursive loss-network semantics, and leakage identity.
- Added nine conformance tests covering monotone-curve refusal, fan and loss
  composition identities, a unique sign-changing nominal bracket, stall
  refusal, three speed points, leakage sensitivity and flow balance, the
  convection handoff, and provenance separation for equal-nominal models with
  different uncertainty authority. The focused remote Cargo lane passed all
  nine tests on RCH worker `ovh-a` (job `j-29943194691043331`).
- The retained fan fixture and uncertainty allowances are synthetic. No
  manufacturer curve/tolerance corpus, unequal parallel-fan model,
  installation-effects model, CFD comparison, experimental validation, or
  capability-maturity registration is claimed by this slice.

## 10. Differentiation, Adaptivity, Planning, And Self-Knowledge

The second addendum wave made derivatives, goal-oriented accuracy, and economic
planning first-class rather than incidental: gradients now carry evidence,
planners refuse when budgets are inadequate, and value-of-information work
turns ignorance into a priced queue.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-adjoint` gained a ledger-DAG VJP registry, fail-loud missing-gradient
  behavior, differentiability mitigations, interval residual gradient
  certificates, explanation objects, DWR accept gates, and exact Hessian-vector
  products for density misfit.
- `fs-dwr` added goal-oriented error estimation, anisotropic metric synthesis,
  marking, tile-level adaptivity scaffolding, and contract-level accuracy
  boundaries.
- `fs-ir` added a greedy fidelity-ladder planner, anytime query semantics,
  colored intervals, priced tightening hints, and explicit refusal reports.
- `fs-plan` added value-of-information query planning that ranks surrogate rung
  climbs and physical validation probes by decision impact per dollar.
- `fs-flywheel-e2e` added whole-loop, phase-1, and phase-2 gates that measure
  the compound effect of speculation, recompute, sheaf merges, tombstones,
  adjoint gradients, and planner ladders.

## 11. Extended Physics, Numerics, And Solver Kernels

The FLUX and BEDROCK layers broadened from core abstractions into usable
simulation kernels: harmonic FEEC analysis, domain decomposition, pressure-
robust flow, FMM/BEM, LBM, vortex particles, time slabs, and large-domain

## 15. 2026-07-09 Mainline Expansion: Flagships, Decision Loops, And Proof Hygiene

The window from
[`319cb64`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/319cb64f052d76e15882ee53ace41092881c7fa8)

[`e08e302`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/e08e30280bcd7af05ae55e990b129d6f75192ead)
is another implementation-heavy mainline slice, not a formal release. It adds
63 commits across 116 files, with 16,163 insertions and 369 deletions. The work
broadens flagship coverage, strengthens decision-making loops for optimization
and uncertainty, and fixes campaign checks that had been too correlated or too
underspecified to support the claims around them.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-ornith` lands as a smoke-tier ornithoid aircraft flagship with parameter
  decoding, BEM/VPM screening, e-raced candidate elimination, LBM refinement,
  SOS-style trim certificates, conformal lift/drag bands, Pareto-atlas rows,
  replay evidence, and a checked-in contract.
- `fs-topopt` gains a feature-gated `cutfem-marquee` lane for topology
  optimization over density-as-SDF fields, DWR-guided octree refinement,
  zero-remesh iteration logs, and topology/thickness witnesses.
- `fs-solver` adds Stokes-class saddle-point machinery: Schur approximations,
  block preconditioners, and PMINRES coverage over the FEEC mixed-space surface.
- `fs-dfo` expands from many-objective hypervolume accounting into NSGA-III,
  MOEA/D, contribution archiving, and world-fork steering. `fs-uq` adds chance
  constraints, seismic uncertainty helpers, anytime stopping, and adaptive MLMC
  admission checks.
- `fs-bo` adds inducing-point sparse Gaussian-process support and then hardens
  the sparse/exact comparison so approximate covariance loss is visible instead
  of smoothed over.
- `fs-ascent` adds interior-point and SQP constrained polish engines, a
  FrankenScipy oracle lane, Rosenbrock basin checks, and a Problem-IR study
  runner.
- `fs-render` adds edge-aware differentiable rendering and an inverse-rendering
  objective surface, while `fs-wasm` exposes deeper upper-stack kernels and a
  certified campaign browser tier.
- `fs-gen` lands as a proposal-only generation crate with compiler-enforced
  epistemic boundaries, making generated candidates explicit about what they
  are not allowed to certify.
- `fs-flagship-e2e` lands as an L6 replay suite for the flagship family:
  smoke/mid/full stage wiring, frozen smoke-stage content hashes,
  cross-flagship LBM and e-race audits, structured failure drills, forensic
  JSON rows, and ignored mid/full fidelity lanes for later perf cadence.
- `fs-mesh` hardens full-Ruppert refinement by checking candidate Steiner
  points against hull-facet diametral balls before insertion, while `fs-topopt`
  tightens the marquee tests around faster deterministic topology, benchmark,
  and thickness witnesses.
- `fs-simd` adds a `frontier-sme2` exploratory capsule for a runtime-gated
  streaming-mode 16x16 f32 GEMM tile, registers the unsafe boundary, documents
  the SME2 safety invariants, and adds a hardware-optional battery that keeps
  unsupported machines inert.
- End-to-end proof hygiene improves across `fs-flutter-e2e`,
  `fs-neuroshape-e2e`, `fs-flowcert-e2e`, `fs-truss-e2e`, and
  `fs-metamat-e2e`, including independent flutter stability checks, closed
  neural-shape boundary frames, steady-state credibility maps, corrected
  duality-gap enclosure direction, and PSD certificate symmetrization.
- HELM and flywheel surfaces gain a budget allocator, moonshot allocation
  tests, self-knowledge e2e battery, epistemic-engine acceptance gate, and
  Phase 3 horizon gate.

## 16. Post-SME2 Follow-Up: Browser Flagships, Mesh Decisions, And Perf Lanes

The window from
[`e08e302`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/e08e30280bcd7af05ae55e990b129d6f75192ead)

[`6725739`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/6725739f42b878b310e7e7e318fb8c980cef71f3)
adds another 42 committed changes across 77 files, with 6,195 insertions and
219 deletions. This is still a moving `main` snapshot rather than a package
release, but it closes several proof lanes that were active in the prior
changelog endpoint and opens clearer continuation surfaces for performance
work.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-wasm` now exposes live flagship browser pipelines rather than only
  lower-level browser kernels. The new `flagships` module exports reduced but
  real `run_ornithoid`, `run_vessel`, and `run_frame` paths that compose the
  corresponding aircraft, laminar-pour vessel, and seismic-frame stacks into
  browser-facing headline reports.
- `fs-mesh` closes the v2 constrained-recovery lane and the v3 interior-facet
  recovery decision. The stack now includes conforming PLC segment recovery,
  exact-predicate ear clipping for simple non-convex planar facets, a
  measured 10-million-point performance lane, and a recorded boundary-layer
  decision: hull-edge protection was measured counterproductive, while
  weighted exudation remains the honest continuation for residual near-coplanar
  slivers.
- `fs-mesh` also adds a feature-gated hex-dominant meshing surface with SH9
  frame fields, MBO smoothing, and a polycube fallback, keeping the frontier
  capability behind `frontier-hexmesh` while preserving the default test lane.
- `fs-sparse` and `fs-substrate` gain a compact CSR performance path, sharded
  deterministic SpMV, tiled deterministic parallel assembly, real shared STREAM
  bandwidth slices, and NUMA first-touch helpers. The work records all-core
  roofline progress while keeping the broader `fs-sparse-perf` lane open.
- `fs-rand` adds fast-path deterministic normal generation through a ziggurat
  sampler, bitwise-equivalent bulk Philox fills, and a dev-only statistical
  stream battery. The strict distribution contract remains explicit about which
  pieces are performance paths and which pieces are certification gates.
- `fs-fft` adds complex-to-real inverse support plus 2D/3D N-D pencil
  transforms, expanding the transform surface that downstream physics and
  visualization crates can use without leaving the deterministic math layer.
- IO, risk, and packaging code paths were made more fail-closed: `fs-io`
  rejects fractional and negative PLY face-list values, conformance tests stop
  using direct panic arms, CVaR/objective/probe inputs reject non-finite values,
  `fs-robust` removes unwrap/tail-slice panic surfaces, and `fs-package`
  includes provenance in package roots while removing unreachable string-write
  panics.
- `fs-topopt` records the CutFEM-octree marquee as a zero-remeshing topology
  evolution contract and adds invalid-density-shape rejection, while the SME2
  prototype remains documented as an exploratory, runtime-gated capsule rather
  than a portable default lane.

[`e993e76`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/e993e7640a547ca9b11ded6d580a3ce6846a4c82)
adds 119 committed changes across 169 files, with 11,967 insertions and 1,317
deletions. This update is still a moving `main` snapshot, not a tagged release,
but it materially hardens the lower-level semantics that later simulation
claims rely on.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-math` now pins deterministic integer-power behavior and extends `xtask`
  policy checks so dependent crates do not drift back to platform-sensitive
  `.powi` calls without an explicit review point.
- `fs-exec` and `fs-rand` bind stream replay to declared run identity rather
  than execution-pool history, preserving stochastic replay when scheduling or
  worker counts change.
- `fs-race` and `fs-session` now require caller-owned cancellation gates for
  race losers and memory-pressure pauses. Cancellation and pause/resume
  authority is visible to the owner instead of hidden inside convenience
  registrations.
- `fs-exec` wraps solver snapshots in a versioned, self-authenticating envelope,
  giving resumable solver state an artifact boundary suitable for pause,
  migration, fork, and replay checks.
- `fs-la` extends the GEMM performance program with packed f32 and
  mixed-precision BLIS-style paths, transposed/strided op-form GEMM, measured
  blocking defaults, batched small-dense perf tests, and roofline regression
  evidence lanes.
- `fs-uq` now computes empirical CVaR with fractional boundary weighting, which
  avoids under-reporting risk at quantile boundaries and locks the behavior with
  regression tests.
- `fs-adjoint` fails closed on vacuous certificate evidence and retains
  executable regressions for explain and DWR acceptance paths.
- `fs-io` accepts legal face-before-vertex PLY element order while keeping
  payload validation in place, separating valid file ordering from malformed
  face data.
- `fs-render`, `fs-geom`, and small lint/test cleanups remove dependency,
  Lipschitz-bound, and boundary underflow traps that could otherwise surface as
  confusing downstream evidence failures.

## 18. Golden Governance, Certificate Soundness, And Failure Compounding

[`81c11df`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/81c11df36fb421d0e7bbfede4c094c96602dce6f)
turns several determinism and certification incidents into governed repository
surfaces. It spans 87 files, with 4,913 insertions and 660 deletions. The
important change is not just more tests: semantic dependencies, replay
identities, package payloads, and minimized failures became inspectable data.

### Delivered capability

- `golden-couplings.json`, semantic-surface version constants, and `xtask
  check-goldens` now identify which downstream sentinels must be deliberately
  re-frozen when a bit-producing surface changes. `docs/GOLDEN_POLICY.md`
  requires committed-tree reproduction, both build modes, a plausible
  bit-moving cause, and a same-commit registry update.
- `xtask check-claims` ties README-cited hashes, `fs-*` crate names, and named
  sentinel functions to the tracked tree instead of trusting manually
  maintained capability prose.
- Deterministic-power enforcement expanded across workspace surfaces, while
  dimension exponent arithmetic now refuses overflow instead of narrowing,
  wrapping, or saturating silently.
- `fs-evidence::Certified<T>` became an opaque validated trust boundary, and
  `fs-sos` separated algebraic decomposition checks from rigorous global or
  radius-scoped value bounds. Under-calibrated conformal bands now return an
  honest unbounded interval rather than finite under-coverage.
- Evidence-package schema v2 began carrying complete color payloads,
  provenance, magnitude budgets, and roots through a strict parser. The
  solver-free checker re-derives budgets and roots, rejects hostile or
  incomplete transport, and treats signature validity as an injected
  capability rather than inferring it from signature presence.
- `fs-obs::ident` introduced typed, versioned, length-prefixed replay identity
  with float-bit encoding, explicit exclusions, dependency roots, and
  collision-boundary tests. Flagship metric identities migrated onto that
  surface and their expected golden changes were re-frozen deliberately.
- Topology fixes aligned closed-cube component counting with 26-connectivity
  and made persistence penalties count components alive at the requested
  level, removing phantom tunnels and historical-bar over-counting.
- `fs_bisect::compound` now turns a counterexample into a deterministic
  regression family: capture, greedy shrinking, bounded neighborhood probes,
  content-addressed manifests, tracking references, replay, and stale-family
  detection. Its first fixture reduces the real `.powi` incident to the exact
  `k = 7` divergence boundary and reproduces the manifest on both reference
  ISAs in debug and release.

Package checking in this slice proves structural and content-root integrity; it
does not rerun solvers or establish scientific truth. The schema-v2 in-tree
default also makes no cryptographic signature-validity claim. Failure
compounding returns a minimum under the caller's shrink order, not a global
minimum, and it records recommended admission rules without enacting them.

## 19. Reproducible Bootstrap, Canonical Replay, And Honest Performance

[`81c11df`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/81c11df36fb421d0e7bbfede4c094c96602dce6f)
through
[`cdb62ee`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/cdb62eea326e523fed26048d4d53c717bf43d455)
span 111 files, 6,443 insertions, and 836 deletions. This wave made
bootstrap, replay identity, package semantics, hardware placement, and
performance admission more reproducible while retaining measured misses as
explicit evidence.

### Delivered capability

- `xtask bootstrap-constellation` now materializes locked dependencies into
  detached, transform-free checkouts; verifies existing heads and cleanliness;
  supports offline caches and mirror transport; distinguishes provable
  case-collision artifacts from unrelated dirt; and writes bootstrap
  provenance. A layer inversion found during this work moved package coverage
  out of `fs-crosswalk` and into the legal L6 dependency direction.
- DSR quality coverage gained Cargo-metadata-derived feature lanes, visible
  `required-features` skips, standalone `fs-wasm` native/build lanes, complete
  per-lane logs with tested-tree identity, and derived repository inventories.
  The inventory is also checked against README crate, contract, and test counts.
- Canonical typed replay identity spread into capability fingerprints,
  reports, flagship metric streams, and steered-study fingerprints. Vessel,
  LBM, and BEM paths replaced platform `sin`, `cos`, `powf`, `atan2`, `ln`,
  and related calls with deterministic math, restoring the poured-mass and
  ornithoid ROA metrics to their full cross-mode hash streams.
- Evidence-package schema v3 added backward-only composition receipts,
  falsifier records, and content-hashed dataset anchors. The checker recomposes
  parent evidence, refuses color laundering and refuted claims, and keeps those
  semantics bound into the package root without importing solver code.
- Package admission was tightened across in-memory verification, JSON parsing,
  and standalone checker diagnostics: complete provenance, unique claim IDs,
  finite/ordered payloads, exact integer handling, magnitude-overflow refusal,
  and bounded bytes, depth, nodes, containers, tokens, and strings.
- `fs-sparse` gained optional FrankenNumpy dense-array conversion interop with
  explicit copy/densification semantics, shape and overflow refusal,
  non-finite rejection, and documented treatment of stored and signed zeros.
- Linux affinity syscalls were isolated in a registered capsule; measured L3
  groups, first-touch audits, advisory TilePool CCD pinning, hugepage/THP
  provenance, and A/B harnesses made machine placement measurable. Per-kernel
  SIMD tier audits found and repaired a slower NEON scale path and an x86
  fused-multiply-add path that had fallen back to per-element libm calls.
- Autotuner persistence began refusing foreign probes, invalid pins,
  noncanonical records, and refresh-counter exhaustion. Per-worker throughput
  rows also demonstrated that bandwidth-rich and bandwidth-starved machines
  can select different schedule families without changing result bits.
- The roofline gate gained an `EnvironmentInvalid` result after a saturated
  host collapsed both the measured machine roof and the kernel by roughly the
  same factor, producing a vacuous passing ratio. Absolute plausibility floors,
  over-roof detection, and run-wide poisoning now prevent that false
  performance certificate.
- FFT moved to mixed radix-8/4/2 Stockham stages and improved raw M4 throughput
  by 11–18%, but the corrected traffic model left attainment around 16–25%; the
  40% gate remained open. Batched f32 and mixed f32-storage/f64-accumulation
  GEMM also landed without claiming the still-unmet 60% small-dense target.

Affinity, hugepages, prefetch distance, and schedule selection are
machine-specific measurement surfaces, not portable speed guarantees. The
bootstrap fetch path was exercised through mirror transport rather than a new
clean remote host. Package verification remains solver-free structural and
semantic checking, and at this point package roots were still the in-house FNV
content address rather than the later BLAKE3 schema.

touch 119 files, with 13,684 insertions and 1,863 deletions. They establish the
first production-facing GEMM measure-cache-model-dispatch path, move package
integrity onto domain-separated BLAKE3 roots, and extend the repository's
failure-compounding doctrine to issue closure itself. Several commits retain
explicit `wip` boundaries; this section preserves those distinctions.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-roofline` moved its citation boundary from plausible-looking attainment
  ratios to exact timed receipts bound to pre-run machine axes, kernel identity,
  work count, raw sample-duration bits, derived statistics, and verdict.
  Admission re-derives every row, corroborates post-run axes, and makes analytic,
  tampered, duplicate, invalid-axis, or drifted measurements non-citable.
- A governed historical-baseline API models the remaining sustained-contention
  hole: trusted axes require at least three mutually agreeing, floor-plausible
  runs plus operator, justification, fingerprint, topology,
  OS/architecture/firmware identity, and age policy. First-run measurements are
  candidates rather than self-authorizing evidence; the API marks degraded,
  suspicious, stale, or identity-drifted environments ineligible. Binding that
  admission result into every citable GEMM receipt remains an active blocker.
- `fs-exec` tuning evidence became versioned, unit-safe, canonical, bounded,
  and explicitly non-statistical. Exact wall-time samples determine a
  deterministic ranked argmin; summaries and candidate separation are
  re-derived rather than trusted as independent claims.
- A bounded GEMM block-plan lattice and `fs-session` orchestration now implement
  cold measurement, validated cache adoption, pinned replay, ledger
  read/write-through, and dispatch. Tune rows bind bit semantics, shape,
  requested threads and thread budget, exact probe dimensions, ISA tier,
  placement, and implementation identity through one canonical key.
- Tuning publication was split into prepare, durable persistence, in-memory row
  commit, transactional dispatch, and decision commit. Cancelled or failed
  dispatches do not publish a success decision, and cache imports must match the
  requested execution identity and the ranked-evidence winner.
- `fs-la` added cancellation-aware parallel f64 GEMM with private output
  staging. Cancellation stops new acquisition, drains scoped workers, and
  preserves caller-visible `C` bit-for-bit; only a successful operation crosses
  the documented non-cancellable final-copy boundary.
- Core and batched GEMM paths added checked extent, stride, packing, allocation,
  and tuning-quantum admission before mutation or unsafe SIMD entry. Batched
  f64, f32, and mixed paths also implement `alpha == 0` without reading
  poisoned inputs. The final endpoint still carries open SIMD-pointer and
  batched-semantics workstreams, so this is landed hardening rather than a
  claim that every safe-facade audit is closed.
- The shipped roofline registry now invokes the session-backed GEMM tuner and
  derives §14.1 implementation coverage from registered kernels. A `landed`
  target row means the registry contains the production path; it does not mean
  the declared 75% performance target was met.
- `fs-substrate` added architecture-specific software-prefetch hints and a
  distance sweep that found different optima on the M4 Pro and Threadripper,
  while proving the hint cannot affect result bits. A repository Cargo note
  also records why globally enabling x86 FMA is rejected: LLVM contraction
  changed a Chebyshev golden, so the libm-FMA trap must be repaired in narrow
  pure-`mul_add` target-feature capsules instead of changing workspace-wide
  arithmetic.
- A dependency-free `fs-blake3` crate became the shared safe-Rust content-hash
  owner. Evidence-package schema v4 moved from 64-bit FNV roots to 32-byte
  BLAKE3 roots with distinct derive-key domains for headers, claims, internal
  nodes, and raw artifacts while keeping the checker solver-free.
- A clean-bootstrap audit narrowed the earlier `xtask` claim: Cargo cannot run
  that command before unresolved path dependencies have been materialized.
  Bootstrap now refuses unverifiable substitutions and the docs distinguish
  prebuilt-cache verification from true clean-clone setup. The FrankenNumpy pin
  was advanced past its case-colliding fuzz-corpus filenames, restoring clean
  checkouts on default macOS, but a strict pre-Cargo bootstrap remains open.
- Evidence waivers now bind to exact canonical color payloads rather than only
  a color rank. Package coverage depends on valid authenticated records, and a
  refused package exposes no positive evidence summary that could be mistaken
  for a partial pass.
- Interval Newton gained bounded work and completeness receipts; high-order IGA
  gained degree-aware Gauss-Legendre quadrature; constrained optimization began
  validating complete KKT state; chart agreement became
  `Agreed`/`Disagreed`/`Unknown`; and voxel queries refuse mixed frames,
  unrepresentable coordinates, and unbudgeted dense transforms.
- The cache-blocked six-step FFT passed its correctness and golden batteries but
  measured roughly twice as slow as the existing stage walk, so it remains
  default-off behind `frontier-sixstep`. FEEC's high-order x86 path removed the
  per-element libm `fma` hole, but scalar fused code generation still left the
  30% cross-ISA vectorization target open.
- `xtask check-closures` became the eighth `check-all` lane. A closed bug Bead
  must name retained regression evidence or an explicit disposition, connecting
  tracker closure to the previously landed failure-compounding workflow.

This snapshot does not close every production claim. The exhaustive GEMM
performance oracle was still manual and exercised the legacy parallel path; the
later hardening commits carried no current x86 production-oracle result; GEMM
staging was not memory-budgeted; and worker scopes still used scoped standard
threads rather than a full asupersync `Cx`. The roofline wrapper could also
persist a reusable session tune row during warmup before post-run roofline
admission, so rejected axes withheld citable roofline output without yet
guaranteeing that no tuning state survived. Content roots prove transit
integrity, not scientific truth, authorship, or claim origin. The closure gate
checks that a close reason names regression evidence or a disposition; it does
not resolve the cited artifact and independently prove that artifact passes.

## 21. SIMD Transpose, FEEC Accumulation, And Pre-Cargo Bootstrap

The seven-commit follow-up from
[`f7e9787`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/f7e9787f7dcf412b35642b7fffb7e943d1c64045)
through
[`291c7db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensim/commit/291c7dbfdc6fd366f6ee55a6dbc39f137e05afd6)
touches 19 files, with 1,043 insertions and 104 deletions. It advances two
measured numerical kernels without erasing their remaining no-claim boundaries,
and it moves clean-machine constellation materialization out of the Cargo
workspace so it can run before sibling path dependencies exist.

### Delivered capability

- `fs-simd` gained an 8-by-8-tiled NEON transpose for interleaved complex f64
  matrices. One complex value occupies one 128-bit vector register, so the
  capsule performs exact loads and stores without floating-point arithmetic or
  shuffle-induced bit changes. The scalar twin and tier battery cover irregular
  and tile-aligned sizes, while `fs-fft` routes its six-step transpose through
  the shared operation table.
- The capsule improved the large-transform six-step/stage-walk ratio from the
  earlier approximately 0.44 to measured values of 0.731 and 0.679 on the
  macOS-aarch64 lane. That halves the deficit but does not produce a win, so
  `frontier-sixstep` remains default-off and the existing
  `0x79aa_108f_a517_012f` six-step golden remains unchanged. The tracker released
  `frankensim-27d3` for its next measured lever rather than declaring the
  performance target complete.
- A post-landing audit found that the safe scalar and NEON transpose facades
  compute `2 * n1 * n1` with unchecked `usize` arithmetic before validating
  slice lengths. The endpoint therefore records a measured optimization, not a
  completed safe-facade proof; overflow-safe geometry admission and a retained
  regression are still required before treating the capsule as fully closed.
- `fs-feec` rewrote all three sum-factorized hexahedral contractions to keep
  each output row in a local `[f64; P]` accumulator and store once. The
  per-output operation chain remains `+0.0` followed by ascending-`l`
  `mul_add`, preserving the `0xaaf1_076a_196c_6902` golden while removing repeated
  destination loads/stores and making the const-`P` loops friendlier to SLP
  vectorization.
- The FEEC change measured 0.56-0.70 attainment across `r = 1..5` on the M4
  lane, up from the prior 0.44 row. The commit deliberately leaves
  `frankensim-cwjn` in progress: the x86 gate verdict and the declared both-ISA
  30% target were not complete at this endpoint.
- A follow-up replaced iterator/zip chains inside those register accumulators
  with explicit `0..P` index loops. This exposes constant loop bounds more
  directly to x86 SLP while retaining the same ascending-`l` fused chain; the
  release battery remained 10/10 with the frozen golden unchanged. M4
  remeasurement and the quiet x86 verdict were still pending.
- A standalone `tools/bootstrap` package now lives outside the root workspace,
  has its own empty workspace and lockfile, and uses no dependencies. It can
  parse `constellation.lock`, clone missing siblings at detached pinned commits,
  verify existing sibling HEAD and cleanliness, honor a network-free offline
  mode, use a mirror base, and write deterministic schema-v1 provenance without
  first asking Cargo to resolve the very path dependencies it is meant to
  materialize.
- Hermetic replay drills cover first clone, idempotent offline verification,
  dirty and drift refusal, and offline-missing refusal. The committed close
  evidence also records a real seven-sibling offline verification including the
  case-collision-safe FrankenNumpy pin. `frankensim-1t8i` and
  `frankensim-7n2n` are closed at this endpoint.

The bootstrap closure is narrower than a claim that every hostile invocation
is already fail-closed. The endpoint README and parts of the bootstrap/CI docs
still retain earlier language saying clean-clone bootstrap is unavailable or
open. Code review also found that the newly cloned path re-checks the detached
HEAD but does not apply the existing-sibling clean-tree check after checkout,
and a bare `--root` or `--from` silently falls back instead of refusing a
missing value. These are follow-up documentation and admission defects, not
reasons to erase the landed standalone bootstrap and replay evidence.

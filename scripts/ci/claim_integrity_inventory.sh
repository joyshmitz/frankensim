# claim_integrity_inventory.sh (bead frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.2.1) —
# the checked live inventory of claim-integrity defects.
#
# A claim-integrity defect is a public surface that can assert a STRONGER
# epistemic state than its evidence establishes (docs/CLAIM_INTEGRITY.md).
# Those defects only gate anything if they are countable, so this lane turns
# `br list -l claim-integrity` into a verified report:
#
#   * every entry is logged verbosely: status, priority, severity, crate scope,
#     assignee, and the taxonomy verdict for that entry;
#   * FAIL when an open P0 (severity:default-path) defect has no owner — an
#     unowned P0 is an inventory entry nobody is burning down;
#   * FAIL when an entry carries zero or several severity labels — the gate
#     reads severity to decide what to block, so an ambiguous severity is an
#     ungateable entry;
#   * FAIL CLOSED when the beads store cannot be read or parsed. An inventory
#     that cannot be read is NOT an empty inventory, and a lane that reported
#     "0 defects" because `br` was missing would itself be the exact defect
#     class this lane exists to count.
#
# Priority/severity disagreement and missing crate scope are reported as
# warnings: they degrade the gate's precision without making the entry
# invisible, and closed historical beads keep their original priority by
# policy (history is a record, not a thing to rewrite).
#
# Output is JSON-lines verdict rows plus a human summary, matching the repo's
# output convention. Deterministic: entries are sorted by id.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/claim_integrity_inventory.sh
#   FSIM_CLAIM_INTEGRITY_JSON=fixture.json scripts/ci/claim_integrity_inventory.sh
#
# The FSIM_CLAIM_INTEGRITY_JSON override feeds the lane a fixture snapshot
# instead of the live store; bead .2.4's seeded-fault drills use it to prove
# this lane fails closed without mutating the real beads database.
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 inventory defects found, 2 fail-closed read error.

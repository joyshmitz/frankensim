//! fs-race — e-RACING (plan §9.6, Bet 8 [M]). Layer: L4 (ASCENT).
//!
//! Anytime-valid sequential tests DRIVE structured cancellation: within
//! a generation, per-candidate loss streams feed a full pairwise
//! fs-eproc race matrix; the moment a candidate's elimination evidence
//! crosses the e-BH threshold its kill-handle fires through fs-exec's
//! [`KillRegistry`], cancelling the candidate's whole evaluation tree.
//!
//! BIT-REPRODUCIBLE BY CONSTRUCTION: rounds are the only clock. Every
//! surviving candidate consumes exactly one observation per round in
//! canonical index order, and e-value crossings are evaluated ONLY at
//! round boundaries — the elimination sequence is a pure function of
//! (seed, logical stream identities), never of wall-clock arrival.
//!
//! The [M] discipline: the 2–5× payoff claim is MEASURED (evaluations
//! used vs the fixed-N budget) on separated and inseparable fields
//! alike, and the battery's calibration study checks that the true
//! best is eliminated no more often than α promises. If the payoff
//! were not to materialize on some field, the ledger would say so —
//! that is the point of carrying `fixed_n_equivalent` in the outcome.

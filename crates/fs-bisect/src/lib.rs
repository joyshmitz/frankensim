//! fs-bisect — git-bisect for a wrong number (plan addendum, Proposal 10).
//! Layer: L6 (a version-control/orchestration concern; no numerical deps).
//!
//! Given a linear COMMIT SEQUENCE and a monotone predicate ("QoI within spec",
//! "certificate passes"), binary-search for the first commit that broke a
//! design — `O(log n)` predicate evaluations instead of `O(n)`. Two economies
//! layer on top:
//!
//! - **Two-tier fidelity** ([`bisect_two_tier`]): run the inner search on a
//!   cheap LOW-fidelity oracle (whose localization is only *estimated*), then
//!   CONFIRM the culprit at FULL fidelity (*verified*). If the full-fidelity
//!   oracle rejects the low-fidelity candidate, the search is re-run at full
//!   fidelity rather than returning a confident wrong culprit.
//! - **Non-monotonicity is detected, not assumed** ([`bisect_checked`],
//!   [`verify_monotone`]): a predicate that goes Good→Bad→Good (a regression
//!   introduced, fixed, then reintroduced) violates the bisect precondition;
//!   rather than return garbage, it is flagged with a witness.
//!
//! A bisect is only sound if replaying commit `k` reproduces commit `k`'s
//! state — that determinism is the ledger's `at(t)`/ExecMode contract, not
//! this crate's; here the [`CommitOracle`] IS that replay-plus-predicate.
//! Everything here is deterministic and side-effect-free; the oracle's own
//! (possibly expensive) evaluation runs under the caller's cancellation scope.

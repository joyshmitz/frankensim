//! WRITE-TIME enforcement of the three-color schema (Proposal 3,
//! bead qmao.1): the [`ColorGraph`] accepts only writes whose claimed
//! color exactly matches what its evidence derives: Estimated leaves
//! enter through a validated weak-source gate; positive leaves are minted
//! from typed certificate or anchoring origins authenticated by an injected
//! source authority (or a separately scoped authenticated source
//! waiver); derived colors are recomputed from their parents. An
//! estimated result CANNOT be written as verified (the laundering
//! refusal). Validated claims are re-checked against the CURRENT
//! execution state and every regime exit AUTO-DEMOTES. Certificate artifacts,
//! admitting policy identities, all demotions, and authenticated
//! operation-bound waivers participate in the node provenance hash and cannot
//! be quietly dropped later.
//!
//! The color enum and pairwise algebra live in fs-evidence (usable by
//! every layer); this module is the HELM-side gatekeeper over
//! already-colored values. Rows are canonical JSON lines ready for the
//! event stream; a dedicated schema table is a CONTRACT no-claim.

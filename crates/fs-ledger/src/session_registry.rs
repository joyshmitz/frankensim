//! Crash-stable mutation claims and terminal receipts for fs-session.
//!
//! A claim is committed before caller-owned work begins. Exact retries then
//! observe one of three durable states: newly claimed authority, an existing
//! indeterminate Pending claim, or a verified terminal receipt. Pending work
//! is never silently executed again.
//!
//! Terminal receipt bytes and their owned global audit events commit in one
//! transaction. Every variable-size value is bounded before materialization,
//! payload and receipt BLOB hashes are computed by this crate, and terminal
//! reads rejoin and rehash every owned event. The registry therefore closes
//! both the database-commit/in-memory-cursor window and ordinary partial-row
//! tampering without treating audit JSON as executable recovery state.

//! fs-toleralloc — adjoint-driven tolerance allocation (plan addendum,
//! Proposal 11's commercial kicker). Layer: L4.
//!
//! GD&T (geometric dimensioning and tolerancing) today is assigned by
//! convention and fear. This replaces fear with a CERTIFIED SENSITIVITY: spend
//! tight manufacturing tolerances ONLY where `∂QoI/∂geometry` is large, and
//! provably LOOSEN everywhere else — delivered as savings a CFO understands.
//!
//! The allocation minimizes manufacturing cost subject to
//! `P(performance ∈ spec) ≥ target`, propagated FIRST-ORDER: the QoI variance
//! from independent feature tolerances is `Σ sᵢ² σᵢ²` with `σᵢ = tᵢ / k`. The
//! cost-optimal solution (Lagrange) allocates `tᵢ ∝ (cᵢ / sᵢ²)^{1/3}` — LOOSE
//! where sensitivity is small, TIGHT where it is large — normalized so the
//! variance budget is exactly met.
//!
//! First-order propagation is a LINEARIZATION, so [`robustness_check`] compares
//! it against the QoI evaluated at sampled tolerance-band EXTREMES and flags
//! where the linearization fails. Every loosened tolerance in the
//! [`gdt_report`] carries the certified sensitivity (with its color) that
//! justifies it. Deterministic; depends only on `fs-evidence` and the
//! `fs-math` deterministic scalar kernels.
//!
//! The additive correlated-stack lane admits a bounded lower-triangular
//! correlation factor `L` with binary64-near-unit rows, so `C = L Lᵀ` is
//! positive semidefinite by construction. [`propagate_correlated_stack`]
//! evaluates the signed first-order variance `aᵀ C a`, where
//! `aᵢ = sensitivityᵢ · σᵢ`, and retains the exact external model identity and
//! caller-supplied positional terms in its receipt.
//!
//! DETERMINISM DOCTRINE (bead frankensim-lyms): every transcendental in
//! this crate routes through `fs_math::det` so the "fully deterministic"
//! contract holds cross-ISA by construction — platform libm `ln`/`exp`
//! differ by ≥1 ULP across ISAs and libm versions. `sqrt` stays primitive
//! (IEEE-754 requires correct rounding for it).

# CONTRACT: fs-robust

Objective epistemics (plan addendum, Proposal F): the three colors applied to
the GOAL itself.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L4 (optimization). Depends only on `fs-evidence` (UTIL, the `Color`
lattice). Pure risk + coloring algebra; the environment sample paths (common
random numbers) are supplied by the caller (fs-scenario).

## Public types and semantics

- `empirical_cvar(samples, alpha) -> Result<EmpiricalCvarReport, RobustError>`
  — the canonical finite-sample risk-algebra entry point. Its report carries
  Conditional Value at Risk, the deterministic lower empirical
  VaR/Rockafellar–Uryasev minimizer, the one-based boundary rank, and the
  fractional boundary weight.
- `cvar(samples, alpha) -> Result<f64, RobustError>` — scalar compatibility
  surface delegating to `empirical_cvar`; the mean of exactly the worst
  `(1 - alpha)` empirical mass, with fractional weight on the boundary order
  statistic when the tail mass is non-integral.
- `weakest_color(&[Color]) -> Option<Color>` — the lowest-rank DECLARED
  color; rank ties break by canonical payload bytes, so the result is
  permutation-invariant (bead 6pf9). Declaration-level API: it authenticates
  nothing.
- `weakest_admitted_color(&[AdmittedColor]) -> Option<AdmittedColor>` — the
  lowest-rank ADMITTED color; ties break by canonical payload bytes, then
  admission-receipt node hash — never input order.
- `admitted_headline_for(&ColoredObjective, &[AdmittedColor])` — the positive
  headline: available only when every declared input is covered COUNT-AWARE
  (canonical bytes) by an admitted counterpart; only consumed counterparts
  enter the headline (surplus admitted values a caller holds cannot leak in).
  An Estimated declared input can never be covered, so mixed objectives keep
  a declared-only headline.
- `robust_optimum_admitted(&[(ColoredObjective, &[AdmittedColor])], alpha) ->
  AdmittedRobustReport` — the admitted-evidence contract: EVERY candidate must
  be fully admitted before the run may claim a positive headline (fail
  closed), and the report's headline carries the winner's admission lineage.
- `ColoredObjective { design, cost_samples, input_colors }` — `robust_value`
  (CVaR), `nominal_value` (mean), `headline_color` (weakest input color; errors
  if un-colored).
- `robust_optimum(&[ColoredObjective], alpha) -> RobustReport` — the design
  minimizing CVaR; ENFORCES the amended optimization contract (every candidate
  must be colored) and returns the weakest-input headline color.
- `dominated_by_nominal(robust_cost, nominal_plus_safety_cost) -> Result<bool,
  RobustError>` — the Proposal-F kill-criterion test; non-finite costs are
  refused rather than silently suppressing domination.
- `fragility_curve(capacity_samples, intensities, color) -> ColoredFragility` —
  `P(failure)` = fraction of capacities below each intensity, with a color band;
  output points are canonically sorted by finite intensity.
- `RobustError` — `EmptySamples` / `BadAlpha` / `BadSample` /
  `UncoloredObjective` / `NoCandidates` / `MalformedInputColor` /
  `UnadmittedInput`.

## Invariants

- CONTRACT: `robust_optimum` and `headline_color` REFUSE an un-colored
  objective (no optimizing a fiction with certified precision).
- WEAKEST-INPUT RULE: a headline's color is the minimum-rank input color — a
  verified solve under an estimated hazard is an estimated answer.
- STRUCTURAL GATE (bead 6pf9): `headline_color` and `admitted_headline_for`
  validate every input payload (`validate_color_payload`) and refuse
  structural garbage with `MalformedInputColor` before any rank arithmetic.
- ADMISSION BOUNDARY (bead 6pf9): positive-evidence reporting goes through
  `AdmittedColor` (opaque, capability-minted in fs-evidence/fs-ledger). Raw
  `Color` values remain accepted by declaration-level APIs for rendering and
  diagnostics; they cannot satisfy the admitted APIs.
- CVaR of the tail is `>=` the mean; `alpha ∈ (0, 1)` enforced; non-finite
  samples are refused instead of sorted into risk or headline values. CVaR and
  nominal means use midpoint-centered compensated convex combinations, so
  finite constant samples near `f64::MAX`, mixed-sign extreme tails, and small
  residuals between opposite extremes neither overflow nor silently cancel
  away. The empirical report chooses the lower VaR/minimizer at an
  integral boundary, reports a zero boundary weight there, and otherwise
  includes exactly the fractional boundary mass. Both statistics canonically
  total-order samples, making values and report metadata permutation-invariant.
- A fragility curve is sorted and nondecreasing in intensity (`P(failure)` =
  CDF of demand exceeding capacity), independent of caller input order.

## Error model

Structured `RobustError` values; no panics.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: CVaR, the optimum, and fragility curves are pure functions
of the supplied samples (sampling / common random numbers are the caller's).

## Cancellation behavior

None (synchronous pure functions).

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/robust.rs` (Proposal F): CVaR weights integral and non-integral worst
tails, reports deterministic VaR/minimizer metadata, remains finite for
constant and mixed-sign `f64::MAX` samples, is permutation-invariant, and
rejects bad inputs; the weakest-input color rule; robust vs nominal optima
diverge; the un-colored-objective contract (+ no-candidates); extreme finite
means remain finite and retain a nonzero residual between opposite extremes;
the kill-criterion dominance test;
non-finite dominance costs refuse; unsorted fragility inputs produce monotone
canonical curves; determinism. Admitted battery (bead 6pf9): tie
permutation-invariance, malformed-payload refusal, count-aware coverage
(duplicate declared inputs need duplicate admitted counterparts; estimated
inputs are never coverable), surplus-admitted isolation + order-freedom, and
the wholly-admitted optimum contract with winner-lineage headline.

## No-claim boundaries

- The default robust measure is CVaR over the supplied samples; general
  distributionally-robust optimization over an explicit ambiguity set, and
  adjoint hazard-sensitivity (Proposal 1) via sample-average approximation with
  common random numbers, are the fuller Proposal-F deliverable — this crate
  provides the coloring + CVaR + contract core.
- Enforcing "no optimization against an un-colored objective" at the actual
  `fs-opt` boundary is that crate's integration; here it is enforced in
  `robust_optimum`.
- Environment/hazard/cost artifacts as colored, versioned, provenance-carrying
  distribution objects are fs-scenario's upgrade; this crate consumes their
  samples + colors.

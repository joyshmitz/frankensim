# CONTRACT: fs-alloc

## Purpose and layer
Scope arenas with cancellation-time reclaim independent of allocation count,
unconditional 128-byte alignment, hugepage-eligible chunks with the decision
recorded, sharded object pools, and diffable allocation-site accounting
(plan §5.3). Layer: L0. Depends on `fs-obs` (UTIL) only.

## Public types and semantics
- `ALLOC_ALIGN: usize = 128` — the unconditional alignment policy (superset
  of Apple aarch64's 128 B and x86-64's 64 B cache lines). Every arena
  allocation is aligned to at least this.
- `CachePadded<T>` — `#[repr(align(128))]` wrapper sized/aligned so adjacent
  instances never share a cache line.
- `ArenaPool` (`Clone + Send + Sync`) — configuration (`ArenaConfig`),
  chunk free list, budget enforcement, accounting (`PoolStats`), hugepage
  decision (`HugepageDecision`), and site aggregation (`SiteReport`).
  `reservation_bytes_for_slice` computes the fresh-arena first-chunk
  requirement without allocating, using normalized chunk and alignment rules.
- `Arena` (`Send`, deliberately `!Sync`) — one bump arena per unit of scoped
  work. `alloc`, `alloc_slice_fill`, `alloc_slice_with` return references
  borrowing the arena; `scope`/`ArenaPool::scope` run a closure against a
  fresh (child) arena and reclaim it on exit. Types needing `Drop` are
  rejected at compile time (destructors never run).
- `Site`, `SiteStats`, `SiteReport` — static allocation-site tags with
  cumulative padded-byte/count accounting; reports are sorted and
  deterministic (diffable between runs).
- `HugepagePolicy` / `HugepageOutcome` / `HugepageDecision` — intent, probe
  outcome, and recorded reason; `HUGEPAGE_BYTES = 2 MiB`.
- `ShardedPool<T>` / `PoolItem<T>` / `ShardedPoolStats` — per-shard locked
  free lists (shards `CachePadded`), first-touch construction on the
  acquiring thread, RAII return, explicit `detach` for artifacts that
  graduate out of pooled life.
- `PoolStats::to_event_kind`, `SiteReport::to_event_kind`,
  `ShardedPoolStats::to_event_kind`, `HugepageDecision::to_json` — canonical
  JSON payloads riding `fs_obs::EventKind::Custom` toward the ledger.

## Invariants
1. Every allocation is aligned to `max(align_of::<T>(), 128)` and its byte
   range is disjoint from every other allocation's (G0 law, conformance
   alloc-001/alloc-005).
2. Dropping an arena (completion or cancellation) reclaims all its memory
   with cost proportional to its CHUNK count — O(log allocated-bytes) from
   geometric growth — never to its allocation count; chunks recycle through
   the pool free list (alloc-002/alloc-009).
3. Accounting is exact under the stated granularity: per-arena and per-site
   `bytes` equal the sum of 128-padded payload sizes; `PoolStats::quiescent`
   (no live arenas, all reserved bytes parked in the free list) holds after
   any interleaving of scope completions and cancellations — verified by a
   10^6-cycle G4 storm (alloc-004) and an 8-thread hammer (alloc-006).
4. Cross-scope escape of an allocation, sharing an `Arena` across threads,
   and arena-placing a `Drop` type are COMPILE ERRORS (doctest
   `compile_fail` battery on `ArenaPool::scope`, `Arena::alloc`, `Arena`).
5. The pool budget (`limit_bytes`) bounds OS-reserved bytes (in-use +
   free-listed); on pressure the free list is drained back to the OS before
   refusing. New-chunk bytes are claimed atomically before allocation, so
   concurrent arenas cannot cross the limit through a check-then-increment
   race; counters are released only after the corresponding chunk is
   deallocated, so claimants can observe conservative over-accounting but
   never stale free capacity. Refusal is structured and leaves the pool fully
   usable (alloc-003).

## Error model
All fallible APIs return `Result<_, AllocError>`; `AllocError` is a
structured enum (`Exhausted`, `OutOfMemory`, `LayoutOverflow`,
`ReservationOverflow`) carrying the allocation site, sizes, and budget
context, with teaching `Display` text including ranked fixes (Decalogue P10).
Out-of-memory is a refusal, never an abort (`handle_alloc_error` is not
reachable from this crate). Panics do not
cross the API boundary except caller-supplied closures' own panics
(`alloc_slice_with`), which unwind cleanly: the arena stays usable and the
reserved bytes reclaim with the scope. Lock poisoning from such a panic is
confined; internal locks are held only around plain data structure edits.

## Determinism class
Deterministic: single-threaded workloads with a fixed seed produce
bit-identical `ArenaStats`/`PoolStats`/`SiteReport`/`ShardedPoolStats` JSON
(G5-style check, alloc-007). Reports contain no addresses and no clocks.
Concurrent workloads are deterministic in their FINAL accounting for a fixed
per-thread schedule (per-item counters are exact), but interleaving-derived
quantities (`chunks_created` vs `chunks_recycled` split under contention)
are schedule-dependent — callers wanting bit-stable reports across thread
counts must aggregate per-worker pools keyed by logical identity (fs-exec's
job, plan §5.4).

## Cancellation behavior
No poll points inside this crate (no operation blocks unboundedly; chunk
allocation is one global-allocator call). The crate's cancellation role is
RECLAIM: fs-exec binds one `Arena` per asupersync scope, and cancellation
drops the arena — invariant 2 makes that O(chunks), leak-free (G4 storm),
and independent of how much the cancelled work had allocated. Losing
branches of speculative races reclaim through exactly this path.

## Unsafe boundary
Exactly one registered capsule: `src/raw/mod.rs` (bump-pointer core, chunk
alloc/dealloc; the "arena allocators" zone sanctioned by Decalogue P1),
under 300 lines behind a safe facade, with `src/raw/SAFETY.md` documenting
invariants, the lifetime-erasure argument, and Miri coverage (the capsule is
plain Rust — Miri interprets every path). Registered in
unsafe-capsules.json; enforced by `cargo run -p xtask -- check-unsafe`.

## Feature flags
None. Everything here is `[S]` solid-tier.

## Conformance tests
`tests/conformance.rs`, cases alloc-001..alloc-009 (JSON-line verdicts;
seeded cases carry their seed): unconditional alignment, scope reclaim,
structured budget refusal, the 10^6-cancellation G4 storm (emits a
`storm_assertion` event through fs-obs), shadow-model accounting +
disjointness, concurrent leak-freedom, G5 deterministic reports, recorded
hugepage decisions, and chunk-recycling bounds. Any reimplementation must
pass this suite.
In-module tests additionally verify first-chunk preflight sizing, structured
reservation overflow, and concurrent hard-limit claims.

## No-claim boundaries
- NO claim that hugepages actually back any allocation: without `madvise`
  (P1 forbids FFI; std exposes none) the crate only makes chunks
  THP-*eligible* (2 MiB size + alignment) when Linux THP mode is `always`,
  and RECORDS the decision. Apple platforms: 16 KiB base pages, no THP
  control — recorded as `unsupported_platform`.
- NO NUMA placement claim: first-touch is a hook (pool `make` runs on the
  acquiring worker; arenas are per-worker by design), but node binding and
  CCD-aware placement are fs-exec/fs-substrate territory.
- NO cancel-latency claim (the ≤200 µs tile-boundary target is fs-exec's
  contract); this crate only guarantees reclaim cost and leak-freedom.
- NO claim about accounting granularity finer than 128-byte padding;
  alignments above 128 may consume additional window padding visible only
  as reserved-vs-allocated slack.
- Not yet verified on x86-64/Linux CI (runner pending — same boundary as
  fs-substrate); Linux THP probing is written but exercised only where the
  sysfs file exists.

## Purpose and layer

Performance claims as falsifiable targets: benchmark every registered
kernel against its arithmetic-intensity-derived limit on the actual
machine, ledger the result under the machine fingerprint plus historical
baseline identity, and alert when either drifts. Layer: L6 (consumes fs-substrate, fs-simd,
fs-blake3, fs-exec, fs-session, fs-ledger). Runtime dependencies remain workspace
crates plus `std`.

## Public types and semantics

- `MachineAxes` (`axes::probe()`) — measured axes only: STREAM-triad
  bandwidth (single/all-core, from fs-substrate) and FMA-chain peak FLOPs
  (single/all-core, in-house microbench), plus the fs-substrate topology
  fingerprint. Never spec-sheet numbers.
- `KernelSpec` — identity + intensity model (`bytes_per_elem`,
  `flops_per_elem`), threading axis, explicit `TargetAxis`, and optional
  `target_fraction`.
- `RooflineKernel` — owns its buffers; fallible `run_once` is the timed unit.
- `measure` / `run_registry` — warmup + repetitions →
  [`Attainment`]: median rate, achieved GB/s and GFLOP/s, binding
  `RoofSide`, binding-roof `attainment`, target-axis `target_attainment`,
  relative IQR `dispersion`, and a
  `Verdict` (`WithinBand`/`BelowBand`/`NoTarget`/`EnvironmentInvalid`).
  The invalid verdict carries a reason and is never a performance pass or
  failure. Both entry points are fallible and reject work before invoking a
  kernel: warmups are bounded to 1000, repetitions to `1..=1000`, registries
  to 256 kernels, and aggregate kernel invocations to 250,000 with checked
  arithmetic. Result and sample buffers use fallible reservations.
- `run_admission_error` / `run_passes_measurement_admission` — the aggregate
  measurement boundary:
  require an explicit `AxisBaselinePolicy` whose selected baseline trusts both
  exact pre/post probes, private timed provenance, positive
  work count and sample durations, raw-sample re-derivation, unmodified
  spec/derived fields, and unique kernel identities. Passing this predicate is
  necessary but not sufficient for citation: only the sealed production
  protocol supplies production-registry provenance. GEMM additionally requires
  at least one warmup and an identical sealed decision/path binding after every
  timed repetition. Execution binding v4 binds the complete producer-owned
  `fs_session::GemmExecutionReceipt::receipt_identity`, including every logical
  memory-plan field; the embedded `execution_path` JSON is a diagnostic
  projection, while its adjacent child identity is the authoritative complete
  receipt. Analytic helper rows are deliberately non-citable.
- `finalize_registry_tuning` / `RooflineKernel::finalize_tuning` — apply that
  single aggregate admission decision to process-local state. Both outcomes
  consume the kernel's pending marker; rejection also invalidates its local
  tuner decision. Every registry hook runs even if an earlier hook fails;
  failures are returned together in deterministic registry order after cleanup
  drains. The registry length and ordered kernel/version identities must match
  the result set. Success returns a non-cloneable, one-shot
  `FinalizedRegistryRun` bound to the exact axes, baseline receipt, and result
  receipts. Publication does not happen here.
- `SECTION_14_1_TARGETS` — the plan's target table as data; `landed`
  flips only when the owning kernel registers here (no silent coverage
  gaps).
- `record_run` — one atomic ledger transaction. Admitted GEMM runs publish the
  exact sealed session row from their stable binding (fresh or adopted), plus
  metrics, `benchmark_result` events, and
  roofline `tune` rows keyed (kernel ×
  `roofline-v7:<kernel-version>:run=<finalized-receipt>:op=<operation-id>` × fingerprint LE bytes
  × 32-byte baseline hash). Rows are append-only per finalized receipt and bind
  the exact executable-content identity, operation, baseline, repetition count,
  and post-probe axes. Every measured payload is also stored as a
  content-addressed `roofline-benchmark-result` artifact and linked as an `Out`
  edge of that exact operation; the row binds the artifact hash. Receipt-backed
  production runs also retain the exact canonical fs-la normal/build graph as
  an `fs-la-depgraph-receipt` artifact, link it as an `In` edge, and bind both
  its content hash and exported-domain digest into the operation IR and every
  row. A development-salt production run is report-only: it records a
  structured rejection and publishes no metrics or tune rows. `record_run`
  requires and consumes the matching one-shot token. Rejected input publishes the exact baseline-admission
  event plus one rejection event and an Error op, never normal-looking metrics
  or tuning evidence; storage failures roll back the entire write set.
  The public custom-registry path uses the disjoint
  `roofline-candidate-v1:<kernel-version>:run=...` namespace; exploratory rows
  therefore cannot satisfy or poison the production `roofline-v7` scan.
- `staleness` / `staleness_at` — `Fresh` / `Expired` / `ClockRollback` /
  `FingerprintDrift` / `BaselineUnavailable` / `BaselineDrift` / `BuildDrift` /
  `CorruptEvidence` / `NeverMeasured` per kernel version, fingerprint, selected
  baseline, and exact current executable. Exact current-key rows are
  semantically revalidated against canonical params, artifact bytes and output
  edge, successful operation receipt, admitted baseline, and executable
  identity. Operation fields are metadata-preflighted by fs-ledger before
  materialization; measured artifacts are capped at the exact tune-row length
  and dependency receipts at fs-la's producer-owned 1 MiB ceiling, with a
  source-pin test that fails on independent producer drift. A bound
  refusal is corrupt evidence, never an engine failure. Validation also
  requires the canonical `production-v2` stamp,
  well-formed nonce/pre-probe/post-probe fields, exact dependency artifact
  kind/metadata/bytes, an `In` lineage edge, and a digest recomputed with
  `fs_session::GEMM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT_DOMAIN`. Historical rows validate against
  their own retained receipt; equality with the receipt compiled into the
  current executable is required only for a row claiming that current build.
  A public `custom-registry` row is outside the production namespace and thus
  classifies as `NeverMeasured`, never `Fresh` or `CorruptEvidence`. `Fresh`
  requires the newest current-build op to be no more than 30 days old. The
  successful operation envelope is exact: session, seed, versions, wall-time
  budget, roofline capability, `ok` outcome, absent diagnostic, and monotone
  timestamps all revalidate.
  `staleness_at` takes explicit wall nanoseconds for deterministic replay;
  `staleness` supplies the current clock.
- Sealed production protocol (bead fz2.5): `production::ProductionProbe` /
  `ProductionRun` is the only API path to a production citation candidate. `observe()` performs
  the pre-probe and mints a per-run nonce (callers may read the axes for
  baseline selection but never supply them); `run()` owns production
  registry selection, timed warmup/repetitions, the post-probe (observed
  strictly after the timed loop), aggregate admission, and tune
  finalization; `record()` consumes the run and stamps the operation `ir`
  with `"protocol":"production-v2"`, the nonce, content hashes of both
  observed axis receipts, and the dependency-receipt artifact/digest. Its
  `citation_eligible()` pre-commit predicate additionally refuses the default
  development salt with a structured report-only reason; CLI output cannot set
  `citable:true` until the atomic record succeeds and every row revalidates as
  `Fresh`. The public `record_run` path stays available for
  harness tests but is stamped `"protocol":"custom-registry"` and is
  explicitly NON-CITABLE — a custom kernel wearing a production name,
  replaying a cloned execution binding, or passing the pre-probe twice can
  never wear the production stamp through this API (`tests/production_seal.rs`,
  in-crate drifted-post/finalizer-failure/probe-ordering battery). Type opacity
  seals the API constructor, not the database: the nonce is a process-unique
  challenge, and callers with general `fs-ledger` mutation authority remain a
  trusted-writer boundary. External package/ledger authentication is required
  before evidence can claim authority against a malicious writer.
  `ProductionRunConfig::validate` runs before registry allocation/timing and
  bounds `n` to `1..=2^24`, warmups to `0..=63`, repetitions to `1..=64`, and
  at most 64 combined warmup and timed invocations per kernel. The generic
  custom-registry measurement API retains its separate 1,000-per-field limits.
  Before constructing any production registry buffer, a
  checked integer model derives every shipped kernel's work from the actual
  production shape: axpy + dot + sum vector traffic and FLOPs, plus the square
  GEMM's `24 * side^2` logical bytes and `2 * side^3` FLOPs where
  `side = max(isqrt(n), 256)`. The complete run is refused above `2^39`
  modeled FLOPs or `2^33` modeled logical bytes. These orthogonal limits retain
  the 32 MiB streaming default while preventing both large-shape amplification
  and thousands of minimum-shape GEMM/receipt invocations; all additions and
  multiplications are checked.
  The CLI also caps promotion probes at 1000 and baseline age at
  36,500 days before allocation or loops. Promotion reads the existing store
  through the same 1 MiB bound as runtime admission, serializes same-store
  writers with an OS lock, and opens each uniquely named same-directory staging
  generation with create-new semantics. It syncs the complete generation,
  verifies open-handle/path identity and single-link ownership, atomically
  replaces the prior identity-checked regular file, and syncs the parent
  directory. It never reopens or truncates stale crash generations;
  symlink/special-file stores and staging paths are refused. This durable
  promotion transaction currently fails closed on non-Unix hosts, where the
  required file identities are unavailable. Existing and staged stores must
  each have exactly one hard link. Atomic replacement assumes a stable, trusted
  parent directory: the identity checks detect path/object drift at each check
  point but cannot prevent a privileged writer from swapping the directory
  entry after the final rename. The executable content identity is
  captured before timing and rehashed immediately before recording; drift
  refuses the transaction.
- Ordered result manifest (bead gp3.15, retained in ledger row schema v4): every recorded
  run binds a versioned `result_manifest` (ordinal × kernel × version ×
  payload content hash, canonical JSON) into the operation `ir` and folds its
  domain-separated hash into the finalized run receipt
  (`finalized-run.v2`). Kernel/version identifiers are bounded to 1..=128
  canonical ASCII bytes and JSON-escaped before any admission decision, so a
  refused custom registry cannot corrupt the retained operation envelope.
  Staleness revalidation reconstructs the entire receipt
  from the manifest and the rows stored **today** — baseline receipt bytes,
  every payload in manifest order, manifest hash — and compares it to the
  op-bound receipt. Replacing one payload plus its matching artifact/params, or
  removing/altering any sibling row, classifies every manifested row in that
  run as `CorruptEvidence`. A forged row added beyond the manifest is itself
  corrupt, while untouched manifested rows remain `Fresh`; an unrelated extra
  row is not allowed to revoke valid evidence. The crate-private
  `production::tests` battery executes these receipt-backed attacks. The
  external battery actively proves public custom-registry rows cannot acquire
  Freshness and retains the now-vacuous historical attacks as ignored source.
  Pre-manifest/dependency-receipt rows cannot prove current membership and are
  retired the same way; identical honest reruns stay `Fresh`.
- `kernels::default_registry` — the stable test/meta registry: fs-simd
  axpy/dot/sum (report-only bands in v0). `SeededSlowKernel` is the separate
  meta-test kernel claiming a band it cannot meet. Every built-in constructor
  and registry is fallible: vector sizes must be in `1..=2^24`, each GEMM
  matrix must contain at most `2^24` elements, and GEMM worker budgets must be
  in `1..=4096`. These checks and checked extent arithmetic run before buffer
  allocation; buffers use fallible reservations. Empty midpoint indexing and
  hostile-size capacity panics therefore cannot enter `run_once` through a
  built-in constructor.
- `kernels::production_registry` / `GemmKernel` — the shipped command's
  registry adds real f64 GEMM through
  `fs_session::gemm_f64_session_with_pool`.
  `production_registry_work` is the crate-private source of truth for the
  registry's four per-kernel intensity rows; sealed configuration admission
  evaluates it before allocation, rather than treating vector length as a GEMM
  work proxy.
  One kernel instance owns one tuner, reusable TilePool, and cancellation gate: the first
  warmup closes measure → cache → model → dispatch and later warmups/timed
  reps reuse its validated process-local row. With `--ledger`, the kernel owns
  a dedicated read-only cache connection during measurement: it can adopt a
  valid row from a prior process, but a cold sweep remains buffered as a sealed
  `ValidatedGemmTuneRow`. The measured `Attainment` owns the publication clone;
  only `record_run`, after pre/post axes and every receipt pass
  `run_admission_error`, publishes it in the same transaction as the citable
  evidence. Execution is sequential through exclusive `&mut RooflineKernel`;
  no wrapper lock hides tune state.
- `roofline` CLI bin — axes line, per-kernel JSONL, §14.1 coverage table,
  optional `--baseline <jsonl>` plus required `--firmware <identity>`, and
  optional `--ledger` recording + composite staleness report. Omitting the
  baseline is an explicit report-only candidate run (`citable:false`).

- `regress` module (plan §14.4, bead fz2.4): the regression layer.
  `gate` — DISPERSION-AWARE bands (k·σ against the rolling baseline,
  never a naive threshold), evaluated in a shared normalized scale. An exact
  zero-dispersion baseline yields z=0 for equality and signed infinity for a
  change, so tiny finite regressions cannot disappear behind an absolute
  epsilon. A red arrives WITH its diagnosis: the
  phase-share flame-graph diff ranked by growth. `Cusum` — the
  complementary slow-drift detector (slack k, threshold h) over
  expanding-baseline standardized scores. `slower_this_month` — the
  canonical fallible dashboard question as ONE call: (kernel, drop %, guilty
  phase), refusing non-finite or negative thresholds. Its percentage uses a
  common opening/trailing scale and its phase diagnosis compares those exact
  same seven-night windows; sustained regressed middle nights cannot dilute the
  causal phase shift. Public histories,
  kernels, phase identities/counts, per-history observations, dashboard-wide
  aggregate nights/phase observations, and standardized streams have explicit
  deterministic caps. Night histories use
  strictly increasing unique logical indices (gaps allowed); duplicates or
  reversals are invalid evidence. Calibration is meta-tested: zero false alarms across 20
  kernels × 60 stable nights at the default settings; a 0.3σ/night
  drift invisible to the single-night band trips the CUSUM mid-month.

## Invariants

1. Axes are measured on the machine that runs the kernels, in the same
   process; the compute axis is compiler-achievable FMA throughput
   (conservative where autovectorization misses — the honest direction for
   a denominator). Probe calibration (bead xdgf): timed samples span
   ≥ 5 ms (single microsecond-scale passes sat inside the frequency-
   ramp/scheduler noise floor and wandered tens of percent), and the
   accumulator lane count is REGISTER-FILE-sized per arch (48 on
   aarch64, 64 on x86) — the former 64-lane constant spilled on NEON
   and read the axis ~25% low, which inflated attainments past 1.0.
2. `attainment = measured_rate / min(bandwidth_limit, compute_limit)` with
   limits derived from the spec's intensity model (meta-tested against
   hand calculations). This remains the binding-roof report. Verdicts compare
   `target_attainment` to the declared target: GEMM's 75% row is always divided
   by measured compute peak, even when memory bandwidth is the binding roof.
3. Receipt schema v3 carries bit-exact pre-run axes, intensity spec, target
   axis, warmup count, every raw timed sample, median/p25/p75/dispersion, and
   exact derived-result bits. Rounded decimal fields are display-only. A
   standalone reader can rederive the reported rate, roof, target ratio, and
   variance bar.
4. Ledger rows are append-only per finalized run and keyed by kernel version,
   finalized receipt, fingerprint, and admitted baseline. A drifted fingerprint,
   version, baseline, or executable refuses reuse; a malformed exact-key row is
   corrupt rather than fresh. Payload bytes must hash to a retained artifact
   linked as an output of the row's exact successful op. Current-build evidence
   is fresh through 30 days inclusive, expired afterward, and a clock earlier
   than its newest op fails closed as rollback.
   Every retained artifact read reaches bytes only through fs-ledger's shared
   bounded path; an oversized op row or artifact cannot be materialized merely
   to decide that it is corrupt.
5. Axes must be finite and positive, have a nonzero logical-CPU count, meet
   the 5 GB/s and 5 GFLOP/s single-thread reference-family floors, and have
   aggregate axes at least half their single-thread counterparts. These
   absolute guards catch the extreme bead-1n61 collapse. A second axis probe
   after the registry must also agree within 25% on every axis; changing
   contention poisons the run.
6. Specs, rates, targets, and dispersion are screened before verdict
   arithmetic. Any non-finite/negative input or attainment above 1.5 makes
   the run invalid. One invalid row poisons every verdict in that registry
   run because the shared axes can no longer certify any sibling result.
7. Citable rows are created only by `measure`: `elements > 0`, every elapsed
   sample finite and positive, stored sample count equal to `reps`, and all
   public outputs bit-exactly rederive from the private receipt and exact axes.
   GEMM additionally requires `warmup_runs > 0` so a cold autotune sweep cannot
   masquerade as steady-state kernel time.
8. GEMM warmup and timed repetitions never write a newly measured tune row to
   the durable ledger. The registry buffers the sealed row process-locally;
   `record_run` publishes the exact bound row in the evidence transaction,
   including when the measurement adopted it from a different ledger;
   rejection clears both
   the pending marker and local tuner state, and an already valid durable row
   remains readable without a new sweep. Finalization always consumes the
   marker so registry reuse cannot relabel an old row as newly measured.
   Fresh/adopted/local bindings insert into an empty destination, no-op on an
   identical tuple, and fail closed rather than overwrite a conflicting row.
   Replacement belongs to a separate explicit cache-refresh protocol; a cloned
   or delayed benchmark receipt has no overwrite authority. A successful commit
   consumes its fresh marker, while rollback retains it for retry without
   allowing later reuse to replace a newer cache row.
   Registry finalization additionally compares each kernel's current execution
   binding and pending-row identity with the last repetition sealed in its
   `Attainment`; results from an older run cannot preserve or publish a newer
   unfinalized kernel state. A mismatch forces rejected finalization, which
   drains that newer pending marker and invalidates its process-local decision
   rather than allowing unbound state to survive the refusal.
9. Every citable GEMM repetition binds the same exact scoped tune key, shape,
   canonical MC/NC plan, tuned source, operation-specific SIMD tier, build
   identity, derive-key-domain tune-row hash, and deterministic execution-path
   receipt. Receipt JSON embeds the canonical sealed tune-row preimage, so a
   historical benchmark remains independently re-verifiable after the mutable
   dispatch cache advances. The path proves nonempty completed TilePool panel
   traversals with sequential declared run ordinals, so NC/KC panels have
   distinct deterministic stream identities, while excluding nondeterministic
   steal, worker-distribution, and latency samples.
10. Citable admission additionally requires an explicit `AxisBaselinePolicy`
    whose selected baseline returns `Trusted` for both exact pre/post axis
    receipts. `record_run` binds the bit-exact axis records, declared
    environment/day, canonical baseline preimage, domain hash, and verdict in
    the same transaction. `None` is an explicit unbaselined candidate policy,
    never a permissive default; it publishes no metrics or tune rows.
11. The ledger op's versions field contains a domain-separated hash of the
    actual current executable bytes, not a checkout label or ambient CI
    variable. Each roofline row binds that identity and staleness revalidates it
    against both the successful op and the executable currently asking, so two
    rebuilt binaries cannot share provenance merely because their source
    revision string matches.

## Error model

Measurement APIs return `Result`: invalid resource envelopes are refused before
any kernel execution. Sample reservations happen before the affected kernel's
warmup, and a registry aborts rather than executing a kernel whose measurement
buffers cannot be reserved. A `run_once` failure is annotated with the kernel
identity, warmup/timed phase, and invocation index; it aborts the measurement
without constructing an attainment row. Any registry execution or lifecycle
failure invokes every kernel's idempotent, non-publishing `abort_tuning` hook;
process-local tune rows and decision bindings from a tokenless partial run
cannot survive into registry reuse. The production GEMM propagates session,
tune-key, and execution-receipt refusals through this path rather than panicking.
Observations such as zero rates remain successful measurements with invalid
evidence normalized to finite JSON plus an explicit reason. Ledger interaction returns `fs_ledger::LedgerError`
(structured, machine-actionable). The CLI refuses malformed arguments with
a structured JSON error on stderr and a nonzero exit.

## Determinism class

Not deterministic: wall-clock measurement of a shared machine. The
REPORTING is deterministic given the same measured times (order statistics
with deterministic tie-breaking). Seeds are not applicable; repetition
counts and dispersion make the noise visible instead of hidden.

## Cancellation behavior

The session-backed GEMM carries an `fs_exec::CancelGate` into fs-la's
bounded-poll, request → drain → finalize path. The current synchronous
roofline CLI owns but does not externally expose that gate; cancellation
therefore cannot be requested through the command yet. Other registry
kernels remain bounded by `reps × run_once` and have no tile cancellation
surface.

## Unsafe boundary

None. Safe Rust only; SIMD reached through fs-simd's safe façades.

## Feature flags

None. All v0 behavior is `[S]` default-path.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`: registry run + reporting shape (rf-001);
seeded-slow kernel demonstrably below band on real axes (rf-002);
ledgered run with versioned fingerprint-keyed tune rows, lint-clean (rf-003);
fresh/expiry/clock-rollback plus fingerprint/baseline drift, corrupt evidence,
and never-measured states (rf-004), plus rejection-without-publication (rf-004b);
re-run reproducibility
within stated dispersion allowance (rf-005); CLI smoke incl. §14.1
coverage table and structured refusals (rf-006). Unit tests cover
attainment hand-calculations, order statistics, axes sanity, exact-cap
dependency evidence accepted by both roofline and fs-plan, and a retained
cap+1 dependency classified as `CorruptEvidence` by roofline while fs-plan
returns the typed pre-materialization refusal. The GEMM
registry regression executes the production session call twice and proves
exactly one cold sweep plus two recorded dispatch decisions (warm-row reuse,
not a test-only wrapper). Durable-cache regressions prove all three publication
states: rejected measurement leaves zero rows, admitted evidence atomically
persists the session row plus its roofline row, and a new process adopts the
exact row identity without re-sweeping. Receipt regressions tamper every bound
decision/path field, alter only one repetition, and remove warmup; all refuse
admission. A registry-hook unit test proves the hook receives the complete
pre/post admission decision and drains every hook after a middle failure.
Baseline integration tests prove an unbaselined first run and stable sustained
contention cannot cross `run_passes_measurement_admission`, while admitted ledger rows carry one
canonical `axis_baseline_admission` event.

## No-claim boundaries

- No machine performance claims live in this crate: numbers become
  citable only as ledgered rows with fingerprints (plan §14.1 discipline).
- The compute axis is compiler-achievable FMA throughput, not theoretical
  ISA peak; modest attainment above 1.0 is reported as-is. Attainment above
  1.5 means the shared axis is not credible for gating, whether because it
  was crushed/stale or because a specialized kernel outran the probe by too
  much; the run is retained as invalid evidence and must be re-probed.
- §14.1 family targets other than GEMM remain `landed: false` until their
  kernels register. GEMM is `landed: true` because the shipped production
  registry now executes the persistent session tune path; this is an
  implementation-coverage claim, not a claim that any machine met the 75%
  target.
- Per-CCD bandwidth axes, P/E-core-class split, frequency-state capture,
  and thermal controls are future scope (v0 measures whole-machine axes).
- Static floors plus pre/post agreement cannot detect a host that is already
  degraded before the first probe and remains equally degraded through the
  second. Every citable API and the CLI now require a separately admitted
  `BaselineAxes` through `AxisBaselinePolicy`; reporting-only lanes may run
  unbaselined but their measurements are candidate evidence, never citable.
- `RooflineKernel::elements()` and intensity are asserted by the registered
  implementation. The measurement receipt proves what was timed and how the arithmetic was
  derived; it does not prove a custom trait implementation performed the work
  it claimed. The sealed production registry and executable content identity
  are the implementation trust root. Public callers still supply custom
  pre/post `MachineAxes`; those rows are exploratory and never classify Fresh.
  `ProductionProbe` owns both probes and registry selection for citable rows.
- The sealed production preflight bounds the shipped kernels' declared logical
  FLOPs, logical bytes, and invocation count. It is not a wall-clock, energy,
  physical-memory-traffic, or instruction-count certificate; one bounded cold
  tuning sweep and machine-axis probes add control/calibration work outside the
  four registry intensity rows.
- Dependency receipts are operator-observed, structurally validated evidence,
  not Cargo-authenticated invocation proofs or signatures. Protocol v2 proves
  that the exact bytes compiled into fs-session were retained, rehashed, linked
  to the operation. The receipt command admits only byte-identical results from
  two complete Cargo-discovery-plus-package-hashing derivations, so detected
  movement fails closed instead of producing a mixed snapshot. This is a
  coherence check over an operator-observed filesystem, not filesystem
  transactional atomicity; undetectable ABA mutation remains outside the claim.
  A current-build row is compared with the current
  executable's exported receipt; a foreign-build row remains valid history
  when its own retained artifact and digest agree. Correspondence between the operator-selected Cargo tree and
  the actual rustc invocation remains an explicit no-claim.
- Verdict gating in CI is deliberately absent on shared runners; bands
  bind only on ledgered reference machines (nightly lane, later).
- Baseline promotion authority (bead fz2.7): the `authority` module adds
  a `PromotionAuthorityVerifier` capability with typed verdicts
  (authorized / wrong-signature / unknown-key / revoked-key) over a
  `PromotionAttestation` signed on the record's content hash — which
  binds the canonical schema/domain hash, sorted source receipts,
  band/drift policy, machine identity, and promotion time, so editing
  ANY of them (including the free-text `promoted_by`) invalidates the
  signature. `AttestedBaselineStore::admit_verified` refuses
  unattested/forged/edited records, unknown or revoked keys, and
  promotions whose named source receipts are not in the retained set;
  `citable_axis_admission_authorized` (and
  `AxisBaselinePolicy::with_authority`) re-verify before EVERY citable
  decision and bind the verifying key identity into the admission
  receipt. Rotation = authorize the new key and re-promote; revocation
  retroactively demands re-promotion. TRUST CLASS, stated honestly: the
  in-tree `StaticKeyRegistry` is an operator-governed registry with
  domain-separated keyed-hash tags — tamper-EVIDENT, not unforgeable
  (its tag function is public); unforgeable signatures require an
  EXTERNAL verifier implementation injected through the same trait. The
  UNBOUND `AxisBaselinePolicy` tier remains operator-trusted and its
  receipts say `"authority":"operator-trusted"`.

## Trusted historical axis baselines (bead dfh3)

Sustained-contention detection that pre/post agreement cannot provide.
`BaselineAxes` is an opaque schema-v1 record of the machine's quiet axes with
provenance (named operator, justification, promotion day, and sorted unique
source receipt identities), an age policy (≤ 365 days), and a declared
environment identity (topology + OS + arch + firmware string, compared
verbatim). Its bit-exact canonical JSON has a domain-separated BLAKE3 identity.
Trust laws:

1. First-run measurements are CANDIDATE evidence (`Unbaselined`) — a
   probe can never authorize itself as its own baseline.
2. `promote_baseline` is the only public constructor: ≥ 3 floor-plausible,
   same-identity `BaselineCandidate` values with distinct retained source
   receipt hashes that mutually agree within the reprobe drift band, plus a
   named operator and non-blank justification. The
   promoted value is the per-axis maximum over the runs (a too-low
   baseline would inflate later attainment). Updates are re-promotions;
   no in-place mutation API exists.
3. `citable_axis_admission(pre, post, baseline, identity, now_day)`
   composes absolute floors (last-resort sanity, unchanged) + pre/post
   agreement + baseline bands. Only `BaselineVerdict::Trusted` supports
   citable gates. Distinct refusals: `Degraded` (an axis below 0.70 of
   baseline — the 6-GB/s-on-a-100-GB/s-host counterexample), `Suspect`
   (above 1.15× — not the machine the baseline describes), `Stale`
   (past the age policy), `IdentityDrift` (fingerprint/topology/OS/
   arch/firmware mismatch), `ClockRollback`, `InvalidAxes`, `ReprobeFailed`,
   and `InvalidBaseline`. Every verdict serializes as valid JSON; non-finite
   diagnostic ratios become `null`.
4. `BaselineStore` is a strict bounded JSON-lines store, one baseline
   per fingerprint in deterministic order. Admission revalidates every sealed
   invariant; malformed lines, sub-floor/impossible axes, duplicate source
   receipts/fingerprints, oversized records, and non-monotone replacement are
   refusals, not last-write-wins.

Drills (unit tests in `baseline.rs`): quiet-trusted, sustained
contention refused despite pre/post self-agreement, suspiciously-fast
refused, stale-by-age refused (boundary day still trusts), firmware and
fingerprint drift refused, first-run-not-self-authorizing, all six
promotion refusals, future/rollback clocks, valid-JSON refusal receipts, source
receipt uniqueness, and store round-trip + tamper/duplicate refusal.

## Fail-closed evidence screening (bead fz2.4.1)

Every public regress entry point screens its floating and collection inputs before
any verdict arithmetic: `gate` returns `GateVerdict::Invalid { reason }`
— never Green — for non-finite or negative attainment or phase
durations anywhere in the history and for unusable specs (non-finite
or non-positive k_sigma, or a min_baseline outside 2..=4095); `Cusum::first_alarm`
alarms AT the first non-finite residual (NaN previously reset the
shortfall via `max`, silently suppressing detection) and an invalid
detector spec cannot certify quiet; fallible `standardize` refuses an oversized
stream and maps an admitted history to −∞
from the first non-finite entry so poison never enters the expanding
baseline; duplicate or reversed logical nights likewise invalidate `gate`;
`slower_this_month` rejects malformed global thresholds and reports poisoned
or non-chronological kernels FIRST with an infinite drop and the flaw as the
"why", never skipping them. Mean/dispersion, relative-drop, and phase-share
normalization use scaled arithmetic, so extreme finite values cannot overflow
into a silent NaN or turn an improvement into an invalid regression. Exact
zero-dispersion changes remain scale-independent rather than using an absolute
attainment floor.
`standardize` applies the same rule to its expanding baseline: equal values
score zero, a nonzero residual against exact zero dispersion saturates at the
sign-appropriate finite f64 bound, and positive improvements therefore cannot
overflow into poison or a false one-sided CUSUM alarm.
Phase medians include zero for nights where a phase is absent; sparse phases
cannot select their baseline only from nights where they happened to appear.
Metamorphic property (tested): rescaling phase durations by a constant
(time-unit change) preserves verdicts and attribution ranking.

## No-claim boundaries (regress)

- This module is the STATISTICS + attribution + gate arithmetic; the
  nightly both-machine CI wiring rides the ci-gauntlet pipeline
  (huq.4's lane), memory-regression tracking rides fs-alloc's
  allocation-site diffs, and FrankenPandas trend dashboards ride
  fs-report — the named seams, each consuming these verdicts.
- Suspect-commit bisection hooks are diff-vs-last-green consumers of
  the same attribution output, not re-implemented here.

## Bounded authenticated staleness-history checkpoints (bead vm3i)

The `checkpoint` module seals one exhaustive staleness verification into a
chained checkpoint so sustained probing stops re-paying O(H·(K+4)) ledger
queries per kernel:

- `checkpoint_staleness_history(ledger, kernel, version, fingerprint,
  baseline)` runs the exhaustive per-row verifier once and appends a
  checkpoint row to the tune table under the reserved kernel
  `roofline-staleness-checkpoint:<kernel>` (invisible to production row
  queries, machine-keyed identically to the rows it covers). The body is
  canonical JSON: per covered row a domain-separated content hash over the
  row's full stored identity (kernel ‖ shape_class ‖ machine ‖ params ‖
  measured, length-prefixed), the validated build identity, the op-bound
  dependency-receipt digests, the recorded timestamp, and a verdict.
  Checkpoints chain: `digest_i = blake3_domain(chain-domain,
  prev_digest ‖ body)`; ordinals are dense from 0 and the row's params
  restate the expected digest. Insertion is `tune_put_if_absent` plus a
  read-back equality check, so a colliding ordinal can never overwrite
  sealed history.
- `staleness_at_checkpointed(...)` mirrors `staleness_at` exactly on the
  selection lattice (NeverMeasured/FingerprintDrift/BaselineUnavailable/
  BaselineDrift decided identically, before any chain access). With a
  verified chain, covered rows are checked by content hash and replayed
  through the build/dependency scan from sealed metadata — two bounded
  read queries total, independent of history depth (tested at 40 retained
  runs). Rows newer than the seal (the delta) run the full exhaustive
  validator. Any anomaly FAILS CLOSED: a missing, gapped, duplicate,
  reparse-failing, digest-mismatching, or params-inconsistent chain routes
  the probe to the exhaustive path, and a covered row that was altered or
  removed classifies CorruptEvidence.
- Tombstones are permanent: a row sealed `corrupt` stays corrupt in every
  later checkpoint (re-sealing inherits tombstones before re-validating),
  and restoring the original bytes never un-corrupts the fast-path verdict
  — an operator who trusts checkpoints keeps seeing the incident.
- Sealing over a chain that fails verification is refused
  (`LedgerError::Invalid`): a broken chain is permanent evidence, never
  extended and never overwritten.
- No-claim: the chain authenticates against *later mutation of covered
  history*; it is tamper-EVIDENT, not unforgeable. A writer with tune-table
  access can mint a fresh chain for uncovered history; what they cannot do
  is alter rows under an existing seal (or truncate them) without the next
  checkpointed probe classifying CorruptEvidence. Chain length shares the
  ledger's per-kernel tune-row bound (1024); compaction of old checkpoints
  is future work and must preserve tombstone permanence.

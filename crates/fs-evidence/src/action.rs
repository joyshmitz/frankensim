//! I08.1 evidence-action vocabulary: proposals, responses, dependencies,
//! and budgets for buying uncertainty reduction.
//!
//! Compute refinements and physical experiments share one decision-facing
//! vocabulary ([`ActionProposal`]) without pretending their costs, lead
//! times, or evidence colors are interchangeable. Every proposal targets one
//! claim slice, carries explicit cost states per axis (an unknown cost stays
//! [`CostState::Unknown`] with a named authority gap — never a silent zero),
//! declares dependencies, exclusivity, correlation, expiry, and an evidence
//! color CEILING, and has a stable content-addressed identity so identical
//! proposals are idempotent.
//!
//! The planning/execution split is structural: an [`ActionProposal`] can
//! never carry an outcome color; only an [`ExecutionReceipt`] admitted
//! against the proposal can, and its outcome can never exceed the ceiling.
//! A planned physical test therefore cannot raise evidence until executed.
//!
//! No-claims: cost and response "distributions" are interval envelopes, not
//! parametric distributions; price normalization across currencies is a
//! policy input this module refuses to guess; correlation is carried as
//! group identity only, with no joint-distribution claim; portfolio
//! admission checks feasibility structure (cycles, exclusivity, expiry,
//! duplicate identity), not decision optimality.

//! Opaque admitted scientific color (bead 6pf9, stage S1).
//!
//! [`crate::color::Color`] is a plain DECLARATION enum: any crate can write
//! `Color::Verified { .. }` and structural payload validation cannot tell an
//! admitted certificate from a fabricated literal. This module splits the
//! epistemic-rank REPRESENTATION from admission AUTHORITY: an
//! [`AdmittedColor`] has private fields and exactly one constructor,
//! [`AdmittedColor::from_receipt`], which demands three things —
//!
//! 1. a structurally valid, POSITIVE (Verified/Validated) candidate color;
//! 2. an [`AdmissionReceipt`] carrying the color-write row identity that
//!    admitted it (node provenance hash, row schema version, color-algebra
//!    version, admitting policy fingerprint);
//! 3. an [`AdmissionVerifier`] capability that authenticates the pair.
//!
//! Receipts are plain data — anyone can build one — because authority lives
//! in the VERIFIER, exactly like the waiver and source-origin capabilities:
//! the default [`NoAdmissionVerifier`] refuses everything, so at this layer
//! NOTHING admits. The real verifier is injected by the admission authority
//! (HELM-side `ColorGraph`, which re-derives the receipt from its replay-
//! audited node state); a lying verifier is visible at the composition root,
//! the same trust model as a lying `WaiverVerifier`. This crate stays at
//! UTIL layer: it never depends on the ledger, it only names the shape the
//! ledger must authenticate.
//!
//! Defense in depth: even a verifier that accepts everything cannot mint an
//! [`AdmittedColor`] from a malformed payload, a non-positive rank, or a
//! stale-algebra receipt — those refusals fire HERE, before the capability
//! is consulted.

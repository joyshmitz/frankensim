//! I04.1 conservation-defect ontology: one typed accounting language for
//! balance defects.
//!
//! Cell residuals, port mismatches, remap errors, solver defects, jump work,
//! and unowned losses become comparable and composable only through one typed
//! receipt: [`BalanceDefectReceipt`]. The ontology pins quantity/species
//! semantics, extensive-versus-rate meaning, sign/orientation, spatial
//! chain/cochain support, time/window support, producer identity, the
//! accounting chart, expected closure, the measured defect, split
//! numerical/material/model uncertainty, the evidence color rank, and stable
//! content-addressed lineage.
//!
//! Exact zero, bounded defect, unknown, unowned remainder, and inapplicable
//! are DISTINCT states ([`DefectState`]) and never collapse into each other.
//! Receipts compose over disjoint spatial partitions and adjacent time
//! windows without double counting; every incompatibility refuses with a
//! named rule ([`BalanceRule`]).
//!
//! No-claims: this module accounts for defects it is HANDED — it does not
//! detect physical events, does not convert between unit scales, assumes
//! non-relativistic mass accounting, and adds split uncertainties linearly
//! (the conservative perfect-correlation bound), claiming no independence.

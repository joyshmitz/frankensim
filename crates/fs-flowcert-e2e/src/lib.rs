//! fs-flowcert-e2e — FlowCert: a certified credibility map for a lattice-
//! Boltzmann channel flow. Layer: L4 (ASCENT).
//!
//! # The campaign
//!
//! A CFD run gives you a number; it does not tell you whether to believe it.
//! This illuminates the operating space of a lattice-Boltzmann channel and
//! certifies credibility at every point, composing crates never designed to meet:
//!
//! - **The simulation + its exact solution** ([`fs_lbm`]): each channel is
//!   marched to STEADY STATE (not a fixed step budget — otherwise a slow
//!   high-Reynolds transient would masquerade as inaccuracy), then compared to
//!   the ANALYTIC Poiseuille solution: a manufactured-solution accuracy check
//!   that reflects the inherent `O(1/ny²)` discretization error.
//! - **The scaling certificate** ([`fs_lbm::plan_scaling`]): the lattice scaling
//!   planner derives `ν`, `τ`, and the Mach number for the target Reynolds and
//!   flags the regime `Verified` only when comfortably stable (positive viscosity,
//!   low Mach, safe `τ` margin) — the operating-envelope certificate.
//! - **Illumination** ([`fs_archive`]): MAP-Elites over (Reynolds × resolution)
//!   keeps the most-accurate operating point in every niche — the credibility
//!   atlas, not a single run.
//! - **Honest colors** ([`fs_evidence`]): once converged, EVERY point matches the
//!   analytic solution, so the credibility differentiation is the REGIME — a
//!   point accurate AND comfortably stable is `Verified`; a near-`τ=½` point is
//!   flagged `Estimated` as risky even where it is (currently) accurate.
//!
//! Deterministic; no dependencies beyond the composed crates.

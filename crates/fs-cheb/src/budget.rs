//! Typed budgets, admission preflight, and cancellable entry points
//! (bead frankensim-sj31i.55, slice 1).
//!
//! The classic fs-cheb entry points describe work as bounded merely
//! because a scalar maximum exists; a caller can select enormous
//! degrees or matrix dimensions and drive unadmitted allocation and
//! O(n³) work with no `Cx`, no memory admission, and no cancellation.
//! This module adds the RESOURCE CONTRACT: a [`ChebBudget`] declares
//! typed caps, [`ChebAdmission`] derives the WORST-CASE samples,
//! coefficients, work operations, and peak temporary bytes with
//! CHECKED `u128` formulas BEFORE any allocation (a saturating or
//! overflowing size refuses instead of iterating), and the budgeted
//! entry points thread an explicit [`Cx`] with cancellation polls at
//! bounded round/sweep boundaries. Terminal states are EXPLICIT:
//! `Complete` carries a [`WorkReceipt`]; `Cancelled` carries the spent
//! receipt plus a RESUME point where scientifically meaningful;
//! refusals are typed [`ChebError`]s — never a panic from size
//! arithmetic.
//!
//! Slice-1 coverage: the adaptive [`Cheb1`] constructor (resumable),
//! the Dirichlet collocation eigensolve (partial eigenvalues on
//! cancellation), and the fixed-grid root scan (no partial claim — an
//! incomplete scan is not a root set). The classic panicking APIs are
//! unchanged this slice; `cheb2`/`colleague`/`fourier`/
//! `orr_sommerfeld` budgeting is recorded follow-up scope in
//! CONTRACT.md and the bead.

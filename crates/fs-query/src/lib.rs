//! fs-query — geometry queries (plan §7.4). Layer: L2.
//!
//! The interrogation layer every consumer calls constantly (FLUX
//! embedding, ASCENT constraints, LUMEN), UNIFORM across chart types:
//! everything here speaks `&dyn Chart`, so the same query runs against
//! analytic fixtures, F-rep CSG, dense SDF grids, and mesh charts —
//! and the conformance battery holds their answers to the multi-chart
//! AGREEMENT discipline (same abstract region ⇒ same answers within
//! composed certificates).
//!
//! - [`closest_point`] / [`closest_point_clipped`]: Newton projection along the chart gradient,
//!   with the post-projection residual REPORTED (not assumed);
//! - [`raycast`]: conservative sphere tracing from each chart sample's
//!   rigorous trace-value enclosure and local Lipschitz theorem — only an
//!   actually evaluated endpoint inside the certified safe ball is admitted,
//!   and the battery checks that no-tunneling path against a dense oracle
//!   including tangent rays;
//! - [`OffsetChart`]: dilation/erosion as a chart wrapper (`φ − r`);
//!   [`minkowski_ball`] IS that wrapper — the ball case of Minkowski
//!   sums is exact (general Minkowski is a CONTRACT no-claim);
//! - [`ClearanceField`] + [`separation`] / [`separation_clipped`]:
//!   `c(p) = φ_A⁺(p) + φ_B⁺(p)`
//!   is a nominal convenience field; rigorous separation additionally
//!   requires both charts' exact-distance theorem, validates rigorous
//!   per-node enclosures, and subtracts the exact-distance 2-Lipschitz
//!   nearest-node slack;
//! - [`thickness_at`] / [`min_thickness`] and their `_clipped` variants:
//!   the THICKNESS ESTIMATOR —
//!   inward-normal bisection to the opposite wall, cross-checkable
//!   against medial poles ([`medial_poles`], filtered Delaunay
//!   circumcenters), explicitly labeled [`NumericalKind::Estimate`], and
//!   returning values a design lever can finite-difference through;
//! - [`curvature`]: mean/Gaussian/principal from central
//!   stencils on the signed distance, with a PER-CHART ACCURACY CLASS
//!   ([`CurvatureClass`]) documented and measured under refinement.

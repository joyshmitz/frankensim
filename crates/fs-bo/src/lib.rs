//! fs-bo — Bayesian optimization (plan §9.4 [F]). Layer: L4 ASCENT.
//!
//! In-house Gaussian processes (Matérn ½/3⁄2/5⁄2 with ARD, exact
//! Cholesky inference, QMC-multistart marginal-likelihood fitting),
//! deterministic acquisitions (closed-form EI; q-EI through the
//! Cholesky reparameterization over a FIXED scrambled-Sobol normal
//! bank), and BO loops whose every run replays bitwise. Inner
//! optimizers come from the landed stack: fs-ascent L-BFGS for
//! hyperparameters, fs-dfo CMA-ES for acquisition surfaces.
//!
//! TuRBO trust-region BO, multi-fidelity cost-aware acquisition,
//! inducing-point sparse GPs, and tape-differentiated acquisition
//! gradients are recorded follow-up lanes on the bead.

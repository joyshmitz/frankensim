# CONTRACT: fs-couple

Multiphysics composition through a versioned port-thermodynamic vocabulary: a
lossless interface relation, explicit storage/dissipation/source primitives,
a complete stream-flux bundle, and caller-supplied scalar balance
instrumentation without false passivity.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L3 (multiphysics coupling). Dependency-light: `fs-qty` supplies the
canonical six-base `Dims`/power dimension and `fs-iface` supplies neutral field
function-space roles. No domain solver is a dependency.

## Public types and semantics

- `PORT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`; `StableId` admits a canonical transport-safe ID.
- `PortValueShape` distinguishes scalar, non-empty vector/tensor, and field
  values; field shapes carry separate neutral `fs-iface::SpaceType` roles for
  effort and flow. `PowerPairing` distinguishes scalar product, Euclidean dot
  product, and field duality with explicit integration-measure dimensions plus
  `FieldMeasureSide` (effort-density or flow-density).
- `PortKind` covers mechanical translation, rotational torque/angular velocity,
  fluid pressure/volume flow, thermal temperature/entropy flow, electrical
  voltage/current, magnetic mmf/flux rate, and chemical electrochemical
  potential/amount flow. Each kind owns canonical generalized effort/flow
  dimensions; semantic kind identity remains distinct even when dimensions
  coincide (for example torque and energy).
- `CoordinateBinding` makes basis, frame, and positive orientation explicit;
  `PortTimestamp` carries a named logical clock and tick;
  `ConservationRole` is canonicalized into a sorted, duplicate-free list.
- `PortSchema::try_new` binds stable ID, legacy/current `PortKind`, six-base
  effort/flow dimensions, value/field shape, coordinates, power pairing,
  timestamp, and conservation roles. V2 admission checks that the contraction
  matches the shape, effort × flow has watt dimensions without exponent
  overflow, the measure-adjusted generalized dimensions match the declared
  `PortKind`, and PR-2 schema-only kinds name their non-energy conserved flow
  where one exists. The original three seed schemas retain their PR-1
  Energy-only role vectors exactly.
- `PortKind::scalar_seed_schema` constructs one canonical scalar coordinate of
  any kind without inventing identity, frame/basis, or clock data; retained
  goldens use it to migrate the existing mechanical, fluid, and thermal seeds.
- `STREAM_PORT_VERSION = 1`; `StreamPort` is not a scalar `PortKind` or a fifth
  thermodynamic relation. It bundles signed mass (`kg/s`), canonically ordered
  species/element amount (`mol/s`), three momentum-rate (`N`), energy (`W`),
  and entropy-rate (`W/K`) values under one `StreamChartBinding`. Its fixed
  roles are Energy, Mass, Amount, LinearMomentum, and Entropy.
- `StreamChartBinding` separates the constituent-basis artifact and its
  explicit, canonically ordered species/element axis from the spatial
  basis/frame/orientation. It also binds the state schema, chemical reference
  state, logical clock/tick, gravity datum, and the closed
  `StreamStressWorkConvention`. Stream admission is owner-outward only until a
  public pullback exists.
- `StreamEnergyChart` structurally selects exactly one of: the canonical
  moving-stream enthalpy chart
  `mdot * (h + |u|^2/2 + g*z) + W_deviatoric`; internal energy plus pressure and
  deviatoric Cauchy work; or one coordinate from an exact mixture
  Euler/Legendre family. Internal-energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz, and Gibbs
  selections all reconstruct canonical enthalpy from the retained conjugate
  terms before transported energy is formed. The caller-declared stream energy
  rate must equal the selected chart bit-for-bit.
- `PressureWorkCrosswalk` recomputes `h = e + p/rho`,
  `volume_flow = mdot/rho`, and `mdot*(h-e) = p*volume_flow` exactly.
  `EulerLegendreCrosswalk` recomputes the mixture Euler identity plus enthalpy,
  Helmholtz, and Gibbs transforms. Both also require an
  `ExactIdentityProofRef` bound to the complete stream context.
- `ChemicalEnergyAccounting` admits either energy embedded in the selected
  state potential or one separately proved species-potential power term. It
  refuses dual ownership, a foreign chemical reference, and a foreign or
  wrong-kind partition proof. Explicit species-potential and Euler/Legendre
  modes require a species-only constituent axis.
- `ConservativeJunction::iterate_added_mass_fixed` /
  `iterate_added_mass_aitken` are schema-bound migration bridges for the
  retained mechanical scalar fixture; they must remain bitwise equal to the
  legacy results and are not general FSI operators.
- `ConservativeJunction` admits two conjugate schemas and evaluates the finite
  scalar seed as `SchemaInterconnection`/`SchemaPort` (shared effort, opposite
  flow). It localizes metadata mismatches and refuses non-scalar/non-finite
  evaluation.
- Four closed primitive variants are distinct in `PortPrimitive`:
  `ConservativeJunction`; `StorageElement` with Hamiltonian/free-energy state
  schema and constitutive-gradient operator; `DissipativeRelation` with a
  constitutive family plus mandatory monotonicity/nonnegative-production
  evidence reference; and `SourceOrReservoir` with an explicit signed
  `AccountingBoundary` carrying the same basis/frame/orientation as its port
  plus included-source/external-reservoir treatment.
- The raw scalar `Port` remains a backwards-compatible, non-admitting numeric
  container. The legacy `conjugate_to`/`interconnect` migration oracle composes
  only the original mechanical, fluid, and thermal seed kinds and refuses all
  schema-only kinds; raw construction or arithmetic alone carries no
  dimensional, coordinate, clock, identity, or conservation certificate.
- `interconnect(kind_a, kind_b, effort, flow) -> Result<Interconnection,
  CoupleError>` — a Dirac structure (shared effort, opposite flow) whose
  `interface_power` is `0` exactly (power-conserving by construction); refuses
  incompatible ports. `interface_power(&[Port])` = `Σ effort·flow`.
- `EnergyAudit` — `record`, `max_generation`, `is_passive(tol)`: the legacy
  `is_passive` name checks only caller-supplied scalar interface imbalance at
  each recorded exchange. A nonzero balance is a bug alarm, not a proof of
  whole-system or closed-window passivity.
- `AitkenRelaxation::new(omega_init, omega_max)` + `next_omega(residual)` — the
  scalar Δ² dynamic relaxation factor, magnitude-capped.
- `iterate_fixed_relaxation` / `iterate_aitken` — the added-mass interface
  fixed point under fixed vs Aitken relaxation → `FsiResult { converged, steps,
  solution, final_residual }`.

## Invariants

- The Dirac interconnection conserves interface power EXACTLY (to roundoff) —
  the G0 law; incompatible ports are refused.
- Every admitted v2 schema has a shape-compatible power contraction, a checked
  watt-dimensional effort/flow product, and energy. Rotational, electrical,
  and chemical PR-2 kinds additionally require angular momentum, electric
  charge, and amount respectively; legacy seed role vectors remain unchanged.
  Field duality records separate effort/flow function-space roles,
  includes its integration-measure dimensions in the checked product, and
  explicitly assigns the measure to the density side before kind-specific
  dimension comparison.
- Stable relation IDs cannot alias their owned port/boundary IDs. A
  conservative pair requires distinct port IDs, matching physical metadata and
  clock/timestamp, plus outward-from-owner conventions on both sides. PR-1
  refuses common-frame orientations until a public pullback can prove them.
- Storage, dissipation, and source ownership remain separate typed claims. A
  conservative junction cannot stand in for any of them; a dissipative
  relation cannot exist without an evidence reference; a source cannot exist
  without a named accounting boundary whose coordinate/sign binding exactly
  matches the port.
- Every admitted stream has a non-empty duplicate-free constituent axis, one
  shared outward sign convention, finite fixed-dimension rates, fixed bundled
  conservation roles, and exactly one energy chart. Alternate charts cannot
  enter without exact scalar identities and context-bound durable evidence;
  the actual rate axis must equal the proof-bound axis, chemical power is owned
  exactly once, and pressure/deviatoric work uses the single normative
  Cauchy-tension-positive integrated outward-power convention.
- The energy audit reports an interface-balance failure exactly when some
  caller-supplied exchange has absolute imbalance above `tol` or is non-finite.
- On the added-mass fixture (`μ ≥ 1`): naive staggering (`ω = 1`) diverges while
  Aitken-relaxed coupling converges to `x* = c/(1+μ)`; Aitken never takes more
  steps than a stable fixed under-relaxation.

## Error model

Structured `CoupleError`; no panics. In addition to legacy incompatible kinds,
errors cover invalid IDs/empty shapes, pointwise or field-measure dimension
overflow, non-power products, kind-specific or shape/pairing mismatch, missing
kind-required conservation roles, schema-only kinds sent through the raw
interconnection oracle, localized schema conjugacy mismatch, identity aliasing,
accounting-boundary coordinate mismatch, scalar/non-scalar misuse, wrong
added-mass port kind, and non-finite schema-bound values. Stream errors localize
non-finite fields/components, empty or duplicate constituent axes, non-outward
orientation, proof-bound/actual axis mismatch, species-potential accounting on
an element axis, chart/proof binding or identity mismatches, non-positive
density, chemical double counting, and declared/chart energy-rate disagreement.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: schema admission canonicalizes roles by enum order and
stream admission canonicalizes constituents by typed ID. Exact crosswalks use a
pinned operation order and bit equality; interconnection, relation
construction, audit, and iterations are pure functions of their inputs.

## Cancellation behavior

None (synchronous pure functions).

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

None.

## No-claim boundaries

- The FSI fixture is the classic LINEARIZED added-mass interface map
  (`H(x) = −μx + c`) — enough to reproduce the instability and its fix; a full
  nonlinear FSI solve over real fluid/structure subsystems is the consumer.
- `AitkenRelaxation` is the scalar Δ² relaxer; the vector INTERFACE
  QUASI-NEWTON (IQN-ILS) accelerator and MULTIRATE co-simulation are staged.
- PR-2 admits the rotational/electrical/magnetic/chemical vocabulary and
  kind-specific generalized dimensions. It does not by itself prove causality,
  DAE index, source closure, a constitutive law, or a physical port adapter.
- `ChemicalPotentialAmountFlow` describes species electrochemical potential
  and species amount flow. Reaction affinity/extent rate requires an explicit
  stoichiometric crosswalk and is not represented by that kind.
- The scalar evaluator does not execute vector/tensor/field or general
  multi-port Stokes–Dirac operators. `StorageElement` and
  `DissipativeRelation` carry durable public operator/evidence references; this
  crate does not execute or validate the referenced domain law in PR-1.
- Field-duality admission checks dimension arithmetic including the declared
  measure; it does not prove quadrature, trace pullback, orientation, or the
  numerical duality operator.
- `AlongFrame`/`AgainstFrame` can describe schemas and audit boundaries, but
  PR-1's conservative junction refuses them rather than assuming an unproved
  effort/flow pullback. A later neutral transfer API must make that transform
  explicit before admission.
- PR-3 admits `StreamPort`, one selected energy-accounting chart, exact numeric
  crosswalk identities, and context-bound durable proof references. It does
  not execute the referenced verifier, equation of state, stress operator,
  constituent-map artifact, or chemical partition proof.
- PR-3 freezes a stationary or co-moving accounting surface. It does not model
  boundary velocity, Reynolds-transport terms for a moving/deforming control
  boundary, or cross-frame kinetic-energy transforms.
- PR-3 carries mass, species/element amount, momentum, energy, and entropy
  rates together but does not certify their local closure, derive element or
  charge balances from stoichiometry, or decompose entropy transport from
  production. Those are PR-4 window-audit obligations.
- PR-4 owns closed-window first-law, mass/element/charge,
  entropy-generation, and optional exergy audits. Neither `StreamPort` nor an
  `AccountingBoundary` descriptor is one of those audits.
- The two `fs-iface::SpaceType` entries record neutral effort/flow field roles;
  they do not supply a mortar/Nitsche/harmonic transfer operator, certify that
  the declared pair is dual, or prove inf-sup compatibility for a particular
  domain adapter.
- The energy audit's balances are supplied by the caller each exchange; wiring
  them onto the ledger is the coupling driver's integration.
- Dirac interface losslessness does not establish passivity of component
  storage/dissipation/source laws, spatial or temporal discretization,
  interface transfer, nonlinear iteration, multirate windows, or the coupled
  system. Those obligations require a signed, closed-window energy audit.

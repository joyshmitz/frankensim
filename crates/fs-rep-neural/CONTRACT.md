# CONTRACT: fs-rep-neural

Neural implicit charts: small coordinate MLPs as shapes, Lipschitz-constrained
so certified bounds remain available.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L2 (MORPH / representation). No dependencies — pure Rust (in-house power
iteration for the spectral norm, interval bound propagation).

## Public types and semantics

- `Layer::new(weights, bias)` — a dense affine layer; `spectral_norm(&weights)`
  (power iteration on `WᵀW`); `spectral_normalize(layer, bound)` (scale so the
  spectral norm equals `bound`).
- `MlpSdf::new(layers, bound)` — spectrally normalizes each layer to `bound` and
  records the certified global Lipschitz constant `L = Π σᵢ` (tanh is
  1-Lipschitz). `eval` (tanh hidden, linear output), `eval_grad` (finite
  differences), `eval_interval(lo, hi)` (IBP output enclosure), `lipschitz`,
  `topology_hint`.
- `safe_step_radius(value, lipschitz)` — `|value|/L`, the provably safe
  sphere-tracing step.
- `TopologyHint::Unknown` — the only variant; topology is never inferred from
  the fit.

## Invariants

- The certified Lipschitz constant is a valid UPPER bound: no sampled pair
  violates `|f(x) − f(y)| ≤ L·‖x − y‖`.
- IBP is SOUND: `eval_interval(lo, hi)` encloses `f(x)` for every `x` in the box
  (and collapses to the point value on a degenerate box).
- `‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ L` everywhere.
- A sphere-trace step of `safe_step_radius(f(x), L)` never tunnels: `f` cannot
  change sign within that radius.
- `topology_hint` is always `Unknown` (honest — never claimed from the loss).

## Error model

Total functions; the only panics are structural (ragged/mismatched layer
weights, non-chaining dims, non-scalar output).

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: the spectral norm uses a fixed initial vector; eval, IBP,
and the Lipschitz constant are pure functions of the weights.

## Cancellation behavior

None (synchronous pure functions).

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/neural.rs` (8 cases): spectral norm vs known values; spectral
normalization to a bound; the Lipschitz certificate is never violated; IBP
soundness (+ degenerate box); the gradient is bounded by L; a certified
sphere-trace step never tunnels; topology honestly unknown; determinism.

## No-claim boundaries

- The certificate machinery is complete for ANY spectrally-normalized weights;
  FITTING (DeepSDF-style training from source charts via FrankenTorch, eikonal
  regularization, latent-code conditioning for shape FAMILIES with exact
  autograd Jacobians) is the fuller deliverable, staged — this v0 does not train.
- IBP is the interval evaluator; the tighter CROWN-class linear-relaxation bound
  propagation is a follow-on.
- The gradient is finite-difference here; the analytic / FrankenTorch-autograd
  gradient is the production path.
- Watertightness and Hausdorff agreement vs the source chart come from the
  certificate machinery (fs-rep validity-certificates), never from this crate.

//! SHEAF-ADJUDICATED THREE-WAY MERGE (addendum Proposal 10, bead
//! lmp4.12 — THE CROWN JEWEL; [M], behind the `sheaf-merge` feature
//! until its Gauntlet tier + kill metric are green): the sheaf
//! machinery built for watertightness supplies useful operators, but the
//! fixed-iteration decomposition is a guarded merge heuristic rather than an
//! H¹ certifier:
//!
//! - the union cochain receives a deterministic fixed-iteration gauge
//!   reconciliation → applied automatically only when the nominal post-gauge
//!   residual independently passes the supplied tolerance;
//! - a dominant decomposition remainder is retained only as a CANDIDATE
//!   merge conflict, localized to its supra-tolerance interface cells with
//!   both caller-supplied parent labels. It proves neither H¹, non-exactness,
//!   authenticated provenance, nor that no local repair exists;
//! - NON-GEOMETRIC assignment payloads (load cases, materials) currently
//!   refuse before decomposition. Without the base assignment map, even two
//!   different branch values do not prove a three-way conflict: either value
//!   may be unchanged from the base. No assignment is silently dropped;
//! - trust is CONDITIONED on the complex's spectral gap (Proposal 5,
//!   risk R5): merges in degraded-gap regions are flagged
//!   low-confidence.

//! Admitted finite derived and stratified machine-geometry objects (RD.1a).
//!
//! This moonshot-gated module defines the *objects* consumed by later theorem
//! lanes.  Admission is deliberately structural: it records the algebraic
//! category, coefficient semantics, local chart, equality/inequality/contact
//! roles, finite complexes, stratification, units, frames, computability, and
//! proof-state metadata without claiming that a retained theorem is true.
//!
//! Equality, inequality, contact, and constitutive identities are nominally
//! distinct.  Digest equality cannot erase that distinction:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use fs_geom::derived::{EqualityConstraintIdV1, InequalityConstraintIdV1};
//!
//! fn needs_equality(_: EqualityConstraintIdV1) {}
//! let inequality = InequalityConstraintIdV1::from_bytes([7; 32]);
//! needs_equality(inequality);
//! ```

//! fs-neuroshape-e2e — NeuroShapeCert: certified facts about a neural implicit.
//! Layer: L5 (LUMEN).
//!
//! # The campaign
//!
//! A learned neural SDF renders a shape, but gives no guarantees: how far can a
//! sphere-tracing ray step without tunneling through a thin feature, and which
//! topology facts are actually certified? This campaign proves a safe step and
//! the existence of at least one enclosed negative component. It deliberately
//! makes no exact component-count claim, composing crates never designed to meet:
//!
//! - **The field** ([`fs_rep_neural`]): a small `tanh`-MLP SDF whose
//!   spectral-normalized effective form is `≈ 2.12·Σ tanh(3(±coord − 0.7)) + 6.5`
//!   — provably negative near the origin, provably positive on a surrounding ring.
//! - **A certified Lipschitz constant** — `L = Π σᵢ` (product of spectral norms).
//!   Then `safe_step_radius(f, L) = |f|/L` is a certified sphere-trace step that
//!   CANNOT tunnel through the surface.
//! - **A topology certificate by interval arithmetic** — the network's sound
//!   Interval Bound Propagation (`eval_interval`) proves a central box is
//!   strictly inside (`hi < 0`) and that the FOUR edge strips of a bounding box
//!   are strictly outside (`lo > 0`). Those strips tile the box boundary into a
//!   CLOSED frame (corners overlap), so the component meeting the negative
//!   central box cannot cross it: at least one component is proven to exist and
//!   be ENCLOSED — a proof, not a mesh. (Discrete ring boxes would leave angular
//!   gaps and prove no enclosure theorem.)
//! - **Typed topology evidence**: the negative central box and positive closed
//!   frame construct a [`CertifiedEnclosedComponentExists`]. Its public
//!   [`ComponentCountEvidence`] reports only the global lower bound `>= 1`;
//!   disconnected interior wells or negative exterior regions remain possible.
//! - **A curvature cross-check** ([`fs_viz`]): the origin has a positive-definite
//!   finite-difference Hessian. Without a certified zero gradient this is not a
//!   critical-point or minimum theorem, and never a component-count proof.
//!   `isocontour_crossings` separately localizes the sampled zero set.
//! - **Honest colors** ([`fs_evidence`]): the enclosure candidate is `Verified`
//!   only when the typed closed-frame witness exists.
//!
//! Deterministic; no dependencies beyond the composed crates.

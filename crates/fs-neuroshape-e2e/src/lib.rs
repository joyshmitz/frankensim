//! fs-neuroshape-e2e — NeuroShapeCert: a PROVEN neural implicit shape.
//! Layer: L5 (LUMEN).
//!
//! # The campaign
//!
//! A learned neural SDF renders a shape, but gives no guarantees: how far can a
//! sphere-tracing ray step without tunneling through a thin feature? How many
//! components does the level set actually have? This proves those, composing
//! crates never designed to meet:
//!
//! - **The field** ([`fs_rep_neural`]): a small `tanh`-MLP SDF whose
//!   spectral-normalized effective form is `≈ 2.12·Σ tanh(3(±coord − 0.7)) + 6.5`
//!   — provably negative near the origin, provably positive on a surrounding ring.
//! - **A certified Lipschitz constant** — `L = Π σᵢ` (product of spectral norms).
//!   Then `safe_step_radius(f, L) = |f|/L` is a certified sphere-trace step that
//!   CANNOT tunnel through the surface.
//! - **A topology certificate by interval arithmetic** — the network's sound
//!   Interval Bound Propagation (`eval_interval`) proves a central box is
//!   strictly inside (`hi < 0`) and every box on a radius-ring is strictly
//!   outside (`lo > 0`). A non-empty interior trapped inside a certified-positive
//!   ring is a single BOUNDED component — a proof, not a mesh.
//! - **A Morse cross-check** ([`fs_viz`]): the field has a single interior
//!   minimum (`classify_hessian → Minimum`), and `isocontour_crossings` localizes
//!   the zero set — all crossings fall inside the certified ring.
//! - **Honest colors** ([`fs_evidence`]): every certificate is `Verified`.
//!
//! Deterministic; no dependencies beyond the composed crates.

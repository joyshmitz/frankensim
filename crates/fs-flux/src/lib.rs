//! fs-flux — incompressible Navier–Stokes, FEEC-native (plan §8.3
//! [F], bead tfz.17): H(div)-conforming BDM1 velocities with P0
//! pressures — EXACTLY divergence-free discrete velocities, so
//! velocity errors are independent of the pressure (the de Rham
//! exactness cashing out as PRESSURE-ROBUSTNESS, the correctness
//! property most production codes lack). Interior-penalty viscosity
//! (jumps are purely tangential by conformity), upwinded DG
//! convection on the single-valued face flux w·n, Picard steady
//! solves, IMEX BDF1 transients, and discrete adjoints. 2D
//! triangle-mesh instantiation; 3D, BDM2+, projection time stepping,
//! and LES closures are recorded successors with honesty labels —
//! no turbulence model ships here, and nothing pretends otherwise.

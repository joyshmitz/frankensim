//! fs-cutfem — CutFEM on SDFs (plan §8.1 frontend 2, bead tfz.8): THE
//! MARQUEE BRIDGE. Level-set/SDF geometry simulated with FEM-grade
//! accuracy and ZERO MESHING — the property that lets topology
//! optimization loops rerun physics per design perturbation without a
//! mesher in the loop (Bet 3's biggest single payoff).
//!
//! Layer: L3. The 2D quadtree instantiation of the octree design — the
//! quadtree IS the octree restricted to two axes, sharing the
//! FrankenVDB dyadic-tile alignment (cells at level ℓ are 2⁻ℓ dyadic
//! boxes; a leaf at the tile depth is one FrankenVDB leaf face). The
//! 3D octree instantiation is a recorded no-claim (CONTRACT.md).
//!
//! The pipeline, module by module:
//! - [`sdf`]: the [`CutSdf`] trait — a level-set function plus a
//!   CERTIFIED per-cell enclosure (fs-ivl outward-rounded intervals).
//! - [`grid`]: [`Quadtree`] background grids — 2:1-balanced dyadic
//!   refinement, hanging-node constraints handled in the element space
//!   (non-uniform resolution comes FREE from the tree).
//! - [`quad`]: cut-cell bulk and interface quadrature — recursive
//!   subdivision with certified classification at every level, exact
//!   crossings by bisection, degree-2-exact polygon rules; error
//!   control by subdivision depth.
//! - [`fem`]: Q1 spaces on active cells, Nitsche weak embedded
//!   Dirichlet conditions, GHOST-PENALTY stabilization (small-cut
//!   conditioning), assembly to fs-sparse, fs-solver CG.
//! - [`elastic`]: vector Q1 small-strain elasticity over the same cut
//!   rules, with symmetric vector Nitsche terms, cut-independent
//!   penalty scaling, componentwise ghost stabilization, and an
//!   optional fs-adjoint VJP registration.
//! - [`agg`]: aggregated-element fallback — small-cut cells lend their
//!   ill-supported DOFs to a well-cut anchor by polynomial extension
//!   (belt + suspenders with ghost penalty; policy documented).
//! - [`cond`]: dense conditioning probe for the conformance batteries
//!   (eigenvalue-verified conditioning independence of cut fraction).
//!
//! Determinism: BTree-ordered traversal everywhere, straight-line IEEE
//! arithmetic, fs-solver's deterministic CG — bit-deterministic across
//! runs by construction. Ambition tag: the plan marks CutFEM-on-SDF
//! [F]; per the crate-granular form of the gating rule (the fs-feec
//! precedent) the frontier surface ships as this standalone crate and
//! consumers opt in by depending on it.

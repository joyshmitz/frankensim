//! fs-feec — exterior-calculus core (plan §8.1, Bet 3). Layer: L3
//! FLUX.
//!
//! Fields are COCHAINS on cell complexes; the exterior derivative d is
//! the EXACT integer incidence operator from fs-rep-mesh (dd = 0
//! bitwise is its contract invariant — inherited, not re-proven here);
//! ALL metric information and ALL approximation lives in the Hodge
//! stars and Whitney mass matrices. The payoff: grad→curl→div
//! identities hold to machine precision BY CONSTRUCTION, so spurious
//! pressure/EM modes and checkerboarding are killed structurally, not
//! by stabilization folklore.
//!
//! Element geometry (Jacobians, determinants, inverses, grams) runs
//! through fs-la's batched small-dense kernels — the layout consumer
//! those kernels were built for.

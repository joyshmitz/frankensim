//! Certificate-regime routing doctrine (bead `frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.9.1`).
//!
//! This module fixes a closed, machine-readable claim-to-evidence table. It is
//! descriptive governance data: selecting a row does not mint evidence,
//! authenticate an artifact, or admit a runtime claim. The executable
//! no-authority router lives in [`crate::claim_router`] and is owned by
//! `frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.9.3`.

//! fs-govern — the addendum's machine-readable RISK REGISTER (plan addendum,
//! Part V). Layer: UTIL (pure data + audit; no dependencies).
//!
//! Design principle P8 says the plan itself must be falsifiable, and
//! Governance Rule 2 says a risk (or kill criterion) whose measurement was
//! never instrumented counts as unmanaged — "unmeasured survival is not
//! survival". This crate makes that enforceable: it encodes the ten named
//! risks R1–R10, each with its mitigation, its EARLY-WARNING METRIC, the
//! THRESHOLD at which to act, and the OWNING bead — and provides an [`audit`]
//! that a CI gate can run to fail the build if any risk is missing a metric or
//! an owner, and to report how many early-warning metrics are actually
//! instrumented.
//!
//! The register is the canonical record; [`to_json`] emits it for dashboards.
//! `instrumented` defaults to `false` for every risk (nothing is wired yet —
//! the honest baseline); a risk flips to instrumented only when its
//! early-warning metric is live on a dashboard.

/// The ten addendum risks (Part V).

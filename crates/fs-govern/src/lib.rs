//! fs-govern — the addendum's machine-readable RISK REGISTER (plan addendum,
//! Part V). Layer: UTIL (pure data + audit; `fs-blake3` identity dependency).
//!
//! Design principle P8 says the plan itself must be falsifiable, and
//! Governance Rule 2 says a risk (or kill criterion) whose measurement was
//! never instrumented counts as unmanaged — "unmeasured survival is not
//! survival". This crate makes that enforceable: it encodes the ten named
//! risks R1–R10, each with its mitigation, its EARLY-WARNING METRIC, the
//! THRESHOLD at which to act, and the OWNING bead — and provides an [`audit`]
//! that a CI gate can run to fail the build if any risk is missing a metric or
//! an owner, and to report how many early-warning metrics are actually
//! instrumented.
//!
//! The register is the canonical record; [`to_json`] emits it for dashboards.
//! Instrumentation is EVIDENCE, not a flag (bead xpck.9): a risk counts as
//! operationally managed only when it carries a fresh, content-identified
//! [`InstrumentationReceipt`]; every receipt is `None` today
//! (the honest baseline), so the register is schema-complete but
//! operationally RED — and the audits say both things separately.
//!
//! Sibling modules encode the rest of the addendum's governance as data: the
//! design principles + governance rules ([`doctrine`]) and the nineteen
//! proposals with their kill metrics + owning beads + a completeness audit
//! ([`proposals`]). The distinct expansion-program namespace PR-001--PR-012,
//! with quantitative triggers and fail-closed session observations, lives in
//! [`program_risks`]; it does not replace this crate root's R1--R10 register.
//! The one-bet discipline itself is EXECUTABLE in [`lanes`]: an atomic,
//! idempotent, replayable admission ledger enforcing one active unproven
//! mechanism per independently falsifiable proof lane (bead rjoq.6).

## Purpose and layer
Derivative-free optimization engines (plan §9.3). Layer: **L4 ASCENT**.
Deps: fs-rand (keyed sampling), fs-la (eigendecomposition), fs-math, fs-obs
(canonical conformance evidence), and fs-robust (canonical empirical risk
algebra).
Engines are IR-agnostic (closure objectives) BY DESIGN — routing from
the fs-opt problem IR is a wiring bead once that crate stabilizes
(deliberate collision avoidance, bead 7tv.4 trail).

## Public types and semantics
- `cmaes(f, x0, CmaParams, seed) -> CmaReport` — full-covariance CMA-ES
  with the standard Hansen couplings (log-rank weights, rank-µ + rank-1
  covariance updates, cumulative step-size adaptation): the natural-
  gradient/IGO parameterization. Eigendecomposition via the landed
  cyclic Jacobi with symmetrization + eigenvalue flooring (SPD
  maintenance). Stagnation stops: TolX (σ·√λmax < 1e-12·σ₀) OR TolFun
  (no f_best improvement > 1e-12 relative for 120 generations) — the
  TolFun rule is what frees budget for restart ladders (measured).
- `bipop_cmaes(...) -> BipopReport` — large/small alternation with
  population doubling; per-run budgets scale with λ (≈250 generations);
  the ladder cap counts LARGE runs only; restarts launch from
  deterministic Philox-perturbed starts. The report carries the
  schedule (evidence).
- `nelder_mead(...)` — deterministic simplex polish (no randomness).
- `wasserstein_worst_case(losses, costs, n, rho) -> DroReport` —
  exact dual evaluation for a discrete-support Wasserstein-DRO inner
  supremum, with deterministic dual minimization and a recovered
  support distribution. Kink cases split mass fractionally across
  active supports instead of pretending a single argmax distribution
  realizes the dual value.
- `empirical_cvar(samples, alpha) -> Result<EmpiricalCvarReport, RobustError>`
  — a direct re-export of the canonical `fs-robust` finite-sample risk algebra.
  The report carries overflow-safe CVaR, the deterministic lower empirical
  VaR/Rockafellar–Uryasev minimizer, boundary rank, and fractional boundary
  weight; DFO does not maintain a second order-statistic implementation.

- `steer` module (bead qlvf, lane a): WORLD-FORKING steering (P9).
  `SteeredStudy` = the deterministic (population, stream-index,
  weights) triple + a base seed + the steering LINEAGE; `fork` never
  mutates the parent and records a ledger-ready `SteerEvent`;
  `advance` is a pure function of (seed, stream-index, weights) so
  every branch replays bitwise from its lineage (`fingerprint` is the
  witness). Chance constraints live in `fs_uq::chance` — fs-uq sits
  above fs-dfo through fs-bo, so the integration points that way (the
  dependency cycle the first draft hit is the layer diagram talking).

## Invariants
1. DETERMINISM: the full evolution is a pure function of the seed
   (keyed Philox sampling, `total_cmp` ranking, lowest-index
   tie-breaks) — bitwise rerun-tested and cross-ISA golden-hashed.
2. IGO INVARIANCE: strictly monotone transforms of the objective give
   BITWISE-identical trajectories (tested with exp and cube transforms;
   precondition documented: monotonicity at the resolution of sampled
   values — x³ underflow and exp saturation break injectivity near
   machine-precision convergence, measured during bring-up).
3. Translation equivariance (behavioral, tested).
4. Covariance stays SPD (symmetrize + floor at each refresh).
5. BIPOP schedule = doublings of the base population (shape-tested).

## Error model
Structured panics for modeling errors (empty dimension). Convergence
failure is DATA: `converged: false` with best-found + diagnostics. Empirical
CVaR instead returns the canonical structured `RobustError` and does not panic.

## Determinism class
Bit-deterministic per seed, cross-ISA (golden hash
`0x5441_10a6_afb1_70a1`, bumped once when the TolFun stagnation
criterion was added — semantic justification recorded; verified
identical on both reference ISAs).

## Cancellation behavior
Single-threaded v1; population waves as fs-exec sibling scopes with
cancellation draining are the recorded follow-up (G4 scope there).

## Unsafe boundary
None.

## Feature flags
None.

## Conformance tests
tests/dfo_battery.rs (benchmarks incl. condition-1e6 ellipsoid,
determinism, invariance, BIPOP schedule, NM polish, golden hash);
tests/probe_tmp.rs (success-rate + stagnation-stop regression; filename
is bring-up history); tests/ot_battery.rs (4 cases): Sinkhorn
marginal feasibility ≤ 1e−8 and cost symmetry ≤ 1e−8; the ε-ladder
approaching the 1D monotone-coupling CLOSED FORM monotonically
(0.11 → 0.005 at ε = 0.05 → 0.002); translation covariance
(W₂² of equal translates = t² within 0.2%); OT golden
`0x58eb_8443_224c_a689`; tests/moo_battery.rs: hypervolume vs
hand-computed 2D/3D values including dominated/out-of-reference
degenerate cases; non-dominated-sort front assignment exact;
NSGA-II on ZDT1/ZDT2 at standard budgets (pop 80 × 200 generations —
short runs measurably leave the f2-minimal arm unexplored, documented
in the test) with mean front gap ≤ 0.05 (measured ≤ 0.0008), full f1
spread, hypervolume beating scrambled-Sobol random at MATCHED
evaluations (0.87 vs 0.19 / 0.54 vs 0.00), and bitwise replay; helper
edges for crowding; knee detection hitting a synthetic elbow exactly;
canonical empirical CVaR on 2·10⁵ Gaussian samples vs the closed form
μ + σφ(z_β)/(1−β) within 0.02 (and the lower RU minimizer matching the
VaR); fractional boundaries, tied integer boundaries, mixed-sign extremes,
constant `f64::MAX`, permutations, and direct `fs-robust` parity; MOO golden
hash `0x606f_35d4_bfb8_822a` remains frozen until the canonical accumulation is
run and any bit change is deliberately justified; MC hypervolume vs exact at
m = 2/3 within
0.01 absolute and m = 6 CLOSED FORMS beyond exact reach (single point
∏(ref − p) and two-point inclusion-exclusion, within 8% at 1.2·10⁵
Sobol samples, deterministic per seed with the hit count returned as
the honesty knob); public MC-hypervolume edges match exact
hypervolume's malformed-point ignore policy, empty dimension returns
zero, and zero samples are rejected; bounded archive — dominated
inserts are no-ops, dominating inserts evict, over-capacity eviction
removes the TRUE least contributor (verified against brute-force
keep-(k−1) subset enumeration); tests/nsga3_battery.rs (11 cases):
Das–Dennis counts
(C(p+m−1, m−1) exact: 91 at (3,12), 70 at (5,4)) and on-simplex
membership; public guards reject zero-division directions, invalid
NSGA-III reference directions, empty MOEA/D weights, and zero
neighborhoods at the API boundary; DTLZ2(m=3) at standard budgets —
worst | ‖f‖−1 | = 0.0238 against the unit-sphere-octant front with
98% reference-direction coverage; the MANY-OBJECTIVE claim at m = 5:
NSGA-III beats NSGA-II 6.51 vs 4.39 on MC-estimated hypervolume at
matched budget (the classic motivation, measured by composition with
mc_hypervolume) plus bitwise replay; MOEA/D converges on ZDT1 and is
competitive with NSGA-III on DTLZ2(m=3) at matched budget (2.7457 vs
2.7775 hypervolume in the current deterministic battery) plus bitwise
replay; NSGA-III golden
`0xd912_6c49_f1b1_6897`.
tests/wfg4_battery.rs adds the canonical normalized WFG4 fixture at
`M=3, k=4, l=20`, following the corrected WFG toolkit's `s_multi(30,10,0.35)`,
equal-weight `r_sum`, and concave shape construction. It composes that evaluator
with production NSGA-III at a closure-counted budget of 92 × (400 + 1) = 36,892
objective evaluations per run. The battery checks the analytic `[0,0,6]`
front extreme, the output-reconstructed scaled-sphere identity over deterministic
probes, a wrong-center transformation mutant, exact evaluation accounting, front
distance, Das-Dennis direction coverage, exact 3D hypervolume, and complete
ordered-front bitwise replay. A canonical configuration identity binds units,
seed plus stream kernel/tile, algorithm constants, budgets, gates, versions, and
capabilities. Separate original/replay front children bind every retained decision
and objective bit; the result child binds both roots, actual transform samples,
all metrics and verdicts, and the first differing component/bit when replay fails.
The validated object receipt and four `ConformanceCase` rows retain those roots,
while machine-neutral `BenchmarkResult` rows expose hypervolume and mean front
distance for later trend wiring. The formula source is Huband et al., *A Scalable
Multi-objective Test Problem Toolkit* (corrected EMO 2005 version), cross-read
against jMetal revision `ea7e882f6b8f94b99535921674e62cda7986f20e`.
As in the older fs-dfo aggregate batteries, impossible public-API structural
failures such as an empty front remain ordinary Rust diagnostics before aggregate
emission; gate failures after a front exists retain structured red evidence.
tests/bipop_study_replay.rs adds one G5 study-scale replay receipt for the
production `bipop_cmaes` path on a finite four-dimensional shifted-Rastrigin
fixture. Two independent runs at the recorded seed bind and compare every
public `BipopReport` field, every nested best-run `CmaReport` field, the complete
restart-population schedule, and every closure-counted objective input/value bit.
The fixture identity records units, initial point and shift, budget, target,
base-population and per-restart rules, logical CMA/restart stream coordinates,
stream-semantics version, dependency versions, capabilities, and the exact input
seed. The result identity binds that fixture plus the full public report and
ordered evaluation trace; the validated fs-obs receipt retains both roots and
the actual evaluation/restart counts. A disclosed corruption seed selects one
returned `x_best` coordinate and mantissa bit, produces two identical wire-valid
red `ConformanceCase` records with stable content identities and first-mismatch
diagnostics, and is refused by the test-local merge gate. This battery claims
only exact same-build replay for that recorded fixture: it does not claim
optimizer quality, other objectives/dimensions/budgets/seeds, refreshed
cross-ISA equality, cancellation, checkpoint/resume, or performance.
tests/nelder_mead_study_replay.rs adds the corresponding standalone-family
receipt for production `nelder_mead`. It reuses the fixed two-dimensional
Rosenbrock leg from the crate golden (`x0 = [0.3, -0.2]`, simplex scale `0.2`,
soft maximum `2,000`, impossible target `-1.0`) and retains every ordered
objective callback plus all three public tuple outputs. The accounting gate
reconstructs the initial simplex, recomputes every objective bit, requires the
reported evaluation count to equal the closure count, admits only the bounded
overshoot of one already-started Nelder–Mead transition, and proves the returned
best is the global minimum of the retained evaluated trace. Separate canonical
fixture and result identities bind the units, arguments, standard coefficients,
ordering/budget semantics, dependency versions, complete callback stream, and
returned bits; independent runs must reproduce the complete result frame. A
disclosed `StreamKey` selects one returned coordinate and low mantissa bit. The
test first proves the unsealed edit fails payload validation, then reseals it,
proves exactly that bit and no callback or other output field changed, emits two
byte-identical wire-valid red `ConformanceCase` events, and catches the local
merge gate refusing the typed reference-identity mismatch. This is fixed-input
same-build evidence: the mutation seed is not an optimizer seed, the maximum is
a soft loop-entry budget rather than a strict callback cap, and the receipt adds
no optimizer-quality, broad-input, refreshed cross-ISA, cancellation,
checkpoint, authenticated-ledger, or performance claim.
tests/moead_study_replay.rs adds a full-study receipt for production `moead` on
a short four-variable ZDT1 fixture with eight ordered Das-Dennis weights and
four generations. The fixture identity binds the dimension and bounds, every
`MoeadParams` field, every weight bit, dependency and stream-semantics versions,
and the optimizer's logical stream coordinates. The result identity binds all
forty ordered objective-callback decision/objective bits and every ordered
returned-front `Individual` decision/objective bit. Its independent accounting
gate regenerates the complete initializer from the recorded stream, recomputes
ZDT1 exactly, checks callback count, dimensions and box membership, and requires
each returned individual to be an evaluated, mutually non-dominated point.
Independent production runs must reproduce the complete canonical frame. A
disclosed evidence-generator `StreamKey`, separate from the optimizer's recorded
study seed, selects one returned objective and low mantissa bit; the test proves
the stale payload is rejected, reseals it, proves that sole bit delta, emits
identical wire-valid red fs-obs evidence, and catches the local merge gate
refusing the typed retained-reference mismatch.
tests/dro_battery.rs (4 cases): the one-sample kink LP recovers the
fractional q = [0.5, 0.5] and worst-case value 0.5; tiny-scale kinks
use scale-relative recovery rather than an absolute lambda cutoff;
large radius saturates at max loss; public guards reject
empty/non-finite losses, zero sample counts, invalid radii/costs, and
rows without a zero-cost stay-put support. Each deterministic case emits
its passing aggregate outcome as a canonical fs-obs `ConformanceCase` with
seed zero after its direct assertions; earlier failures remain ordinary Rust
test diagnostics. tests/dro_oracle_battery.rs
(4 cases): closed-form endpoints and monotonicity in rho, exact
tiny-LP strong-duality oracle, robust-decision shift demo, and frozen
DRO golden hash `0xd21c_d092_b4a5_ba98`. tests/steer.rs has two logged
conformance cases plus one empty-population guard regression: a fork leaves
its parent untouched while both branches replay bitwise, opposite weights
steer sibling forks toward opposite Pareto extremes, and zero population is
rejected at construction. Aggregate results use canonical fs-obs
`ConformanceCase` events with their exact input seeds; fork and steering
measurements use separate validated fs-obs `Custom` events that also retain
those seeds. Assertions precede each passing aggregate verdict, so earlier
failures remain ordinary Rust test diagnostics.

The remaining MOO, NSGA-III, OT, and DRO-oracle batteries use the same canonical
evidence boundary. Their 22 ordinary post-assert rows retain the existing suite
and case identities and emit `ConformanceCase` events with Info/Error severity,
failure-record linting, `to_jsonl`, schema validation, print-before-terminal-
assert ordering, and exact input-seed provenance. The cases are:

- `fs-dfo-moo`: `hypervolume`, `nds`, `helper-edges`, `zdt1`, `zdt2`,
  `nsga2-replay`, `knee`, `cvar-ru`, `cvar-ties`, `mc-hv`, `mc-hv-edges`, and
  `hv-archive`.
- `fs-dfo-nsga3`: `das-dennis`, `dtlz2-m3`, `m5-vs-nsga2`, and `moead`.
- `fs-dfo-ot`: `marginals-symmetry`, `eps-ladder`, and `translation`.
- `fs-dfo-dro-oracle`: `endpoints`, `strong-duality`, and `robust-shift`.

The four frozen-hash rows are measurements rather than pre-declared passing
verdicts. `moo-golden`, `nsga3-golden`, `ot-golden`, and `dro-golden` therefore
emit validated object-shaped `Custom` companions under distinct
`<case>/measurement` scopes, with the original case identity retained as the
Custom name. Each companion records actual and expected hashes plus the exact
input roots and logical substream coordinates, then the original frozen-hash
assertion runs unchanged. This preserves the diagnostic row on a golden
mismatch without falsely emitting a passing aggregate.

Seed provenance follows the literal fixtures. MOO uses optimizer input seed 21
and Sobol comparator seed 777 for the ZDT summaries, seed 21 for replay, seed
101 with stream `(kernel=0xC7A2,tile=0)` for Gaussian CVaR, seeds 5 and 6 with
CVaR tile 1 for its golden, MC-HV roots 7, 8, 9, 10, and 42, and edge-call roots
11 and 12. NSGA-III uses seed 17 for DTLZ2, optimizer seed 23 plus MC-HV seed 99
for the many-objective comparison, seed 3 for its golden, and roots 29 and 31
for the composite MOEA/D summary. OT uses root 111 and kernel `0x0007`, with
tiles 1/2 for marginal symmetry, 3/4 for the epsilon ladder, 5 for translation,
and 6/7 for its golden. DRO-oracle uses root 131 with
`(kernel=0x0D20,tile=1)`, root 132 with kernel `0x0D21` and tiles 0..19, and
root 133 with `(kernel=0x0D22,tile=0)`; robust-shift is fixed input.

Fixed-input and multi-root aggregate summaries use seed zero, with every
subordinate root named in the typed detail. `fs_rand::StreamKey` kernel and tile
values are logical input-substream coordinates, never execution seeds. Direct
assertions and expectations remain before ordinary aggregate emission; the ZDT
loop can still emit its first completed case before a later case fails. Silent
parity, guard, and `should_panic` tests remain silent.

The core DFO and success-rate batteries complete the same migration under the
existing `fs-dfo` suite identity. Four ordinary post-assert rows use canonical
`ConformanceCase` events, failure-record linting, JSONL serialization, schema
validation, and their original case identities: `benchmarks`, `igo-invariance`,
`bipop`, and `success-rate`. The `benchmarks` composite carries aggregate seed
zero and names the CMA-ES input roots 1, 2, and 3. `igo-invariance` carries root
7, shared by the plain, exponential, and cubic objective runs. `bipop` carries
root 17. `success-rate` carries aggregate seed zero and names the five optimizer
input roots 1 through 5; its per-seed loop, majority threshold, and failed-run
stagnation bound are unchanged.

The frozen `dfo-golden` info row is not promoted to a passing aggregate before
its hash assertion. It is a validated object-shaped `Custom` measurement with
name `dfo-golden` under the distinct `dfo-golden/measurement` scope. The payload
records actual and expected hashes, aggregate input seed zero, CMA-ES input
roots 99 and 100, the fixed-input Nelder-Mead leg, and a null execution seed.
Those roots are optimizer inputs, not scheduler/execution provenance; these
tests do not create an asupersync execution context or `fs_rand::StreamKey`
substreams. The measurement remains before the original terminal hash assertion
so mismatches
retain their diagnostic row without emitting a false passing verdict. The
deterministic-evolution, translation-equivariance, and Nelder-Mead replay tests
remain assertion-only and silent.

## No-claim boundaries
- No published-ERT-table parity claims yet (in-repo BBOB-class fixtures
  only; the external COCO battery is follow-up).
- The four `fs-dfo` aggregate rows attest only to their completed in-repo
  assertions at the recorded input roots. They do not promote the frozen hash
  measurement to a verdict or claim coverage of other seeds, external benchmark
  corpora, scheduler determinism, or unmeasured success probabilities.
- The standalone Nelder–Mead study receipt covers one fixed two-dimensional
  same-build run. Its mutation seed belongs only to the red evidence generator;
  the optimizer itself has no randomness. The reported maximum is a soft
  loop-entry budget and may be exceeded only while the already-started
  reflection/expansion/contraction/shrink transition drains. The fixture makes
  no strict-budget, quality, all-objective/dimension/configuration, refreshed
  cross-ISA, `Cx`, checkpoint, authenticated-ledger, or performance claim.
- The standalone MOEA/D study receipt covers one same-build four-dimensional
  ZDT1 fixture at one recorded configuration and seed. It exposes only objective
  callbacks and the returned rank-zero subset, not the final population, ideal
  history, neighborhoods, or replacement decisions. It makes no convergence,
  front-quality, hypervolume, coverage, diversity, optimizer-superiority,
  all-objective/dimension/configuration/seed, refreshed cross-ISA, `Cx`, checkpoint,
  parallelism, authenticated-ledger, external-oracle, or performance claim.
- NSGA-III normalization uses the ideal point with FIRST-front
  per-objective maxima as the nadir estimate; the full ASF
  extreme-point construction is the recorded refinement.
- The WFG4 battery claims only the normalized tri-objective `k=4, l=20`
  in-repository fixture and its recorded seed/budget. It does not claim the
  complete WFG suite, external COCO parity, optimizer performance, refreshed
  cross-ISA execution, or asupersync cancellation coverage. The source cross-read
  is not an executable independent WFG/jMetal oracle comparison.
- `mc_hypervolume` is the m > 4 path; its accuracy knob is the
  sample count (standard error √(p(1−p)/n)) — no silent precision
  claim. `HvArchive` eviction uses EXACT contributions (m ≤ 4);
  MC-contribution eviction joins with its many-objective consumer.
- Module `ot`: BALANCED entropic OT only (equal masses asserted);
  unbalanced/partial transport and Sinkhorn divergences (debiasing)
  are follow-up lanes.
- Module `dro`: discrete candidate support only; continuous ambiguity
  sets, adaptive support generation, and coupled decision-dependent
  losses are follow-up scope.
- MOO scope (module `moo`): NSGA-II/III, MOEA/D, exact hypervolume
  m ≤ 4, MC hypervolume beyond m = 4, bounded hypervolume archive,
  and knee detection. Canonical sample-CVaR is re-exported from `fs-robust` at
  the crate root. Gradient-based Pareto tracing (fs-ascent
  continuation), ledger world-forking steering, and chance constraints
  are still split lanes.
- Sep-CMA/low-rank (dim > ~200), NES, DE, DIRECT, TR-DFO: not built.
- No constraint handling (fs-constraint owns kinds; integration later).
- No parallel evaluation waves yet (fs-exec bead).

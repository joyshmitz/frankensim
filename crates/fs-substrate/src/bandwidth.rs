//!
//! These numbers are the roofline's memory axis (plan §14.1) and the
//! bandwidth-rich vs bandwidth-starved schedule decision input (§5.1
//! consequence 2: ~34 GB/s/core on M-class vs ~3.4 GB/s/core on 96-core
//! parts — the SAME kernel needs different schedules).
//!
//! Honest limits (no-claim until the executor exists): per-CORE-CLASS
//! bandwidth (P vs E pinning) needs QoS/affinity APIs outside safe std;
//! we measure single-thread and all-core aggregates and record per-class
//! CORE COUNTS from the topology probe. Timing uses `std::time::Instant`
//! (measurement only — never on a determinism-bearing path).

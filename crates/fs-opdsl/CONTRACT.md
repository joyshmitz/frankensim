# fs-opdsl CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: **L3 FLUX** (deps: fs-feec L3, fs-material L3, fs-la/fs-sparse
L1, fs-tilelang/fs-qty/fs-math L0/UTIL, fs-rep-mesh L2). The typed
operator IR (plan patch Rev C — "the single most important
implementation addition"): physics operators represented symbolically
over FEEC building blocks and lowered so that PRIMAL apply, JVP,
VJP/discrete adjoint, DWR indicators, preconditioner hints, and MMS
studies come from ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Generalizes fs-vskeleton's
`EdgeLaw` seed. "The primal changed but the adjoint didn't" is
structurally impossible: both are derivations of the same tree.

## Public types and semantics

- `Space { degree, n, dims }` — cochain degree (255 = raw vector
  dofs), dof count, `fs_qty::Dims`. Composition requires equality.
- `OperatorDef` — atom/law registry + the unknown's space. Checked
  builders: `apply` (degree AND dims checked → `TypeError`
  `ApplyMismatch`), `add` (`AddMismatch`), `scale` (folds nested
  scales), `pointwise`. An ill-typed operator cannot be represented.
- `Atom` — materialized linear building blocks: `Atom::d` /
  `Atom::d_transposed` (exact ±1 incidence CSR from fs-feec),
  `Atom::mass` (Whitney Galerkin star, symmetric), `Atom::external`
  (the ESCAPE HATCH: hand matrices with `Transpose::Symmetric` /
  `Derived` / `Explicit` — hand atoms pass the same gates and are
  marked `"provenance":"hand"` in every report).
- `PointwiseLaw` — opaque-but-differentiable constitutive nodes
  (value + exact derivative + dims map from one definition);
  `CubicReaction` is the reference law.
- `LoweredOperator` (from `OperatorDef::lower`): `apply` (primal),
  `linearize(u0)` (caches pointwise inputs; slots computed
  STRUCTURALLY in post-order so nested laws index correctly in both
  walks), `jvp` (forward chain rule), `vjp` (reverse chain rule —
  every factor transposed: the discrete adjoint), `materialize()`
  (folds constant linear chains through deterministic
  transpose/spgemm; `None` when nonlinear), `report()` (provenance,
  block hints, tile-kernel metadata, structural fingerprint —
  deterministic).
- `dwr_indicators(r, z)` — algebraic DWR η_i = |r_i·z_i|.
- `mms_poisson_study` — the G1 hook: load from analytic forcing via
  de-Rham + M0, Dirichlet pinning, PCG solve, L2 errors and observed
  orders across a Kuhn ladder, THROUGH the generated operator.
- `fixtures::{poisson, convection_diffusion, reaction_diffusion,
  elasticity, advection_matrix, elasticity_stiffness}` — the
  acceptance operators, defined in the IR. Elasticity's stiffness is
  constitutive-assembled from fs-material's `IsotropicElastic`
  tangent (B-matrix P1, Voigt engineering-shear convention matching
  fs-material).

## Invariants

- d∘d = 0 is honored AT THE IR LEVEL: applying dₖ₊₁ to the image of
  dₖ (also through scale nodes) folds to `Expr::Zero` before any
  float exists.
- Materializing the Poisson chain uses the same spgemm association
  as fs-feec's `stiffness`, so generated == hand BITWISE.
- JVP and VJP are two walks of the same tree with the same
  linearization state: ⟨Jv, w⟩ = ⟨v, Jᵀw⟩ holds mechanically (gated
  per fixture, including the nonsymmetric advection where the gate is
  not vacuous).
- Every scale/add/axpy the executor runs is an fs-tilelang kernel
  with intensity metadata and tier-equivalence twin tests.

## Error model

Construction returns structured `TypeError`s (`ApplyMismatch`,
`AddMismatch`, `UnknownId`) with both sides' spaces. `lower` panics on
ill-typed trees (unreachable through the checked builders). Derivative
calls on nonlinear operators without `linearize` panic with an
actionable message. Shape mismatches in fixture assembly are
structured panics.

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic cross-ISA: atoms materialize through fs-feec/
fs-sparse deterministic paths; the executor's combinators are
fs-tilelang kernels (bitwise across tiers); plan reports are pure
functions of the registry and tree. Golden FNV-64 over Poisson apply,
convection–diffusion JVP+VJP, linearized reaction–diffusion JVP, and
elasticity apply on kuhn(2): `0x8b28_77cc_cb43_7cbc`, recorded on
Apple M4 Pro (aarch64), verified identical on Threadripper (x86_64).

## Cancellation behavior

Bounded synchronous evaluation; drivers own chunking and Cx poll
points (the workspace L0–L3 discipline). No internal threading.

## Feature flags

- `constitutive-graph` — I01.2 opaque constitutive adaptation and batched
  evaluation; default-off under its [F] promotion contract.
- `port-equations` — I01.3 neutral `fs-couple::PortSchema` lowering into typed
  system-IR power equations; default-off under its [F] promotion contract.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `unsafe_code = "deny"`.

## Conformance tests

`tests/opdsl_battery.rs` (11 cases, JSON logging): materialized
Poisson vs hand FEEC bitwise + matrix-free to 1e−13; adjoint identity
⟨Av,w⟩ = ⟨v,Aᵀw⟩ over random vectors for Poisson/convection–diffusion/
elasticity; nonlinear JVP-vs-VJP transpose consistency + generated
chain rule vs fs-ad `Dual64` through the cubic law (both the law's
derivative and the full directional derivative); dd = 0 folded
symbolically (including through scale nodes) and applying as exact
zero; structural rejection of degree, dims, and add mismatches;
generation determinism (regenerated reports byte-identical) with
provenance and kernel-metadata assertions; DWR indicator
localization; MMS Poisson orders ≈ 2 on the n = 4/8/16 ladder THROUGH
the generated operator; elasticity rigid modes (translation +
infinitesimal rotation ≤ 1e−9) and uniform-strain patch (interior
residual ≤ 1e−12); perf comparison hand vs materialized vs matrix-free
MEASURED and logged (sanity bounds asserted; debug-build numbers
documented in the bead close); cross-ISA golden hash.

## No-claim boundaries

- The single-field operator surface remains as documented above; the
  `system` module (bead i94v.1.1.1) adds the multi-field TYPE layer on
  top of it: `SystemDef`/`AdmittedSystem` declare block fields with
  explicit form degree, six-base dims or fs-qty semantic quantity kind,
  basis/frame/orientation references, clock reference, spatial support,
  and state ownership, and admit cross-field structure (sums, atom
  applications, power-conjugate port pairings) BEFORE lowering.
  Ill-typed contractions, mixed frames/clocks, affine-temperature
  misuse (scale/sum/apply on absolute temperature), non-power-conjugate
  pairings, dangling references, non-finite scales, and beyond-cap
  nesting are structured `SystemTypeError` refusals. The admitted
  system mints a `SystemId` (fs-blake3 canonical identity, domain
  `org.frankensim.fs-opdsl.system.v1`) hashing canonical structure
  only: display names are never hash inputs and field/equation tables
  are canonically re-sorted, so renaming/serialization order preserve
  identity while any convention change moves it; byte-identical field
  payloads refuse as ambiguous. NO-CLAIM: the system layer performs no
  lowering, numerical evaluation, or block-preconditioner hinting (the
  solver-stack bead tfz.10 consumes it); pullbacks/clock transfers are
  refusal boundaries, not yet operators; `SemanticType` and `PortKind`
  canonical bytes ride their stable Debug renderings versioned under
  `SYSTEM_IR_VERSION` until fs-qty/fs-couple expose canonical
  encodings; conservation-role bookkeeping stays with fs-couple port
  schemas. All traversals are explicit-stack iterative (depth cap
  refuses work, not recursion). `system::transport` is the versioned
  canonical text transport (magic `fs-opdsl-system-transport-v1`,
  LF/tab records, strict fail-closed parse): any other IR version is a
  `VersionMismatch` refusal pending audited migration; import rebuilds
  a `SystemDef` and RE-RUNS full admission so tampered payloads refuse
  or mint a different identity — the transport carries no authority.
  Round-trip canonicality and the pinned migration golden
  (`sys_014`) hold the identity still; the golden moves only with a
  deliberate `SYSTEM_IR_VERSION` bump and recorded cause. Pullbacks and
  clock transfers are now EXPLICIT OPERATORS, not just refusal
  boundaries: `TransformSignature`/`ClockTransferSignature` register
  named, content-referenced maps between coordinate conventions/clocks,
  and `SystemExpr::Pullback`/`ClockTransfer` are the only admitted
  cross-frame/cross-clock/cross-orientation compositions — wrong
  endpoints refuse with both sides named
  (`TransformEndpointMismatch`), mixed orientations without a
  transform refuse (`OrientationMismatch`), and both tables follow the
  atom identity discipline (content-bearing, canonically sorted and
  remapped, byte-identical payloads refused). NO-CLAIM: v1 transforms
  are space-preserving type-level declarations — the numeric transport
  of values between frames/clocks is the caller's registry's job; the
  IR binds WHICH map was used, never that the map is correct.
- Pointwise laws are scalar diagonal (dof-local). Tensor-valued
  constitutive nodes (hyperelastic energy through `fs_ad::Real`
  generics) and state-dependent laws (plasticity history) are the
  fs-material integration lane.
- MMS hook covers the symmetric-PCG Poisson family; nonsymmetric MMS
  solves and mixed-form studies join tfz.10 (needs nonsymmetric
  Krylov). Convection–diffusion is gated by residual/adjoint checks
  here, not a full MMS solve.
- DWR indicators are the ALGEBRAIC dof form |r_i z_i|;
  element-integrated dual-weighted forms join the higher-order bead
  (tfz.6).
- No common-subexpression elimination beyond scale folding, zero
  elimination, and chain materialization; no symbolic wedge/trace
  nodes yet (they enter with the forms they serve — CutFEM traces
  with fs-cutfem, wedges with the nonlinear FEEC bead).
- Generated kernels: combinators (scale/add/axpy) lower into
  fs-tilelang; SpMV stays in fs-sparse (scatter is a tilelang
  no-claim). Fused matrix-free apply (allocation-free plans) is the
  tilelang-fusion perf lane.
- Perf numbers are debug-build fixture measurements, documented not
  contractual; the ≥80%-of-hand release-build target is the perf-CI
  lane's gate (fz2.4).

## Constitutive-graph adaptation (bead i94v.1.1.2, feature `constitutive-graph`, default-off)

- I01.2 opaque protocol: canonical fs-material law nodes enter ONLY as
  `&dyn LawNode` behind `BoundConstitutiveNode`; the compiler retains its
  OWN `MaterialProvenance` receipt (law/version, state-schema
  version+arity, port dims, compiler-owned differentiability and
  thermodynamic-potential-chart spellings) — proven to survive binding
  exactly with single-field mutation visibility. fs-material never
  imports compiler internals; the dependency arrow points L3-ward only.
- A supplied tangent is EVIDENCE: binding verifies consistent-tangent
  claims against the L3 finite-difference gate before granting the
  `Consistent` lane; `PiecewiseSmooth` routes to a caveated lane;
  `NonSmooth` claiming a tangent refuses typed; unclaimed tangents route
  `DerivativeFree`, where tangent/VJP requests refuse instead of
  differentiating. VJPs are exact transpose contractions of the verified
  tangent. State-owning nodes demand explicit initialization; the state
  codec refuses schema drift with both versions named. The hand-written
  escape hatch binds under identical gates and permanently retains a
  no-generated-consistency marker.
- Batched evaluation (`evaluate_batch`) runs a canonical
  `ConstitutiveGraph` over material-point batches under `fs_exec::Cx`
  with request-drain-finalize: polls at `BATCH_POLL_STRIDE` boundaries,
  drains whole points (never partial), finalizes with a deterministic
  resume cursor whose resumed remainder is bitwise-equivalent to the
  uncancelled run; a defective point refuses the whole batch typed with
  its index named.
- NO-CLAIM boundaries: no SystemExpr grammar splice yet (bound nodes are
  not yet referencable from `AdmittedSystem` equations — that increment
  is identity-sensitive and coordinated with the I01.1 owner); ambition
  [F] promotion (baseline deck, activation threshold, kill criterion,
  reproduction pack) has NOT begun — the feature stays default-off; the
  binding-time tangent gate probes the zero point only (per-application
  re-verification belongs to the generated-program gates).

## Port-equation lowering (bead i94v.1.1.3, feature `port-equations`, default-off)

- `compile_port_equation` imports an already-admitted neutral
  `fs_couple::PortSchema`, re-derives its effort × flow × measure dimensions as
  watts, and generates a three-field boundary fragment plus one
  `SystemExpr::PortPair` power equation. The complete schema identity,
  dimensions, shape/function-space roles, coordinates, clock/tick,
  conservation roles, discretization, accounting role, ownership disposition,
  and orientation sense are encoded into the fragment's identity-bearing
  extension. Reversing orientation inserts an explicit `-1` expression and
  therefore changes the `SystemId`.
- Lumped scalar/vector/tensor shapes receive their exact component extent.
  Field-duality shapes require nonzero caller-supplied effort/flow dof counts,
  retain the neutral `fs-iface` form degrees, and refuse incomplete component
  tuples. Compilation has static batch and metadata caps and returns no partial
  batch on refusal.
- Accounting terms distinguish reversible, storage, source, and dissipation.
  Reversible terms forbid an owner; storage requires one concrete owner;
  sources and dissipative losses require either one concrete owner or an
  explicit durable unowned rationale. Deterministic batches sort by stable port
  ID and refuse duplicate port IDs or reuse of one concrete owner by two terms.
  A concretely owned dissipative term also mints a nominal, domain-separated
  `LossOwnershipId` from the port/schema/owner tuple; algebraic orientation
  reversal does not invent a second physical loss owner. `PortEquationReceipt`
  exposes that identity, the re-derived dimensional proof, exact sign,
  role/ownership, generated `SystemId`, structural-generated authority, and
  explicit no-claim language.
- `tests/ports.rs` supplies G0/G3 scalar and field-duality generation,
  orientation-reversal, canonical batch-order, ownership-uniqueness,
  component-shape, empty-input, and metadata-resource-bomb fixtures. The test
  target is explicitly gated by `required-features = ["port-equations"]`.
- NO-CLAIM: this slice generates structural equations; it does not execute the
  scalar/vector/tensor/field contraction, quadrature, trace pullback, numeric
  port adapter, source/dissipation law, or closed-window audit. Stream bundles,
  stream-vs-effort/flow energy double-count refusal, junction permutations,
  storage/source operator lowering, and reversible skew-block preservation are
  subsequent I01.3 slices. A receipt proves that the supplied schema lowered
  consistently, not that the schema or its referenced physical evidence is
  true. The [F] baseline deck, activation threshold, kill criterion, cost
  percentiles, and independent reproduction pack remain pending, so the
  feature stays default-off.

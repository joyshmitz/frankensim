//! Multi-field equation/type IR with a stable semantic identity
//! (bead i94v.1.1.1). This is the neutral compiler-facing layer above
//! the single-field [`crate::expr`] machinery: block fields declare
//! their differential-form degree, basis/frame/orientation, quantity
//! kind, state ownership, clock, spatial support, and conservation
//! roles EXPLICITLY, and every cross-field composition is admitted
//! before any lowering. Ill-typed contractions, mixed frames, affine
//! temperature misuse, clock mismatches, and non-power-conjugate port
//! pairings are structured refusals — they cannot reach code
//! generation.
//!
//! Identity discipline: a [`SystemDef`]'s [`SystemId`] hashes the
//! canonical STRUCTURE and semantic payloads only. Field and equation
//! display names are never hash inputs, and both tables are re-sorted
//! into a canonical order before encoding, so equivalent renaming or
//! serialization order preserves identity while any meaningful
//! convention change (degree, dims, quantity kind, frame, orientation,
//! clock, support, state slot, pairing, scalar convention) moves it.
//! Two fields whose complete semantic payloads are byte-identical are
//! refused as ambiguous rather than silently tie-broken.

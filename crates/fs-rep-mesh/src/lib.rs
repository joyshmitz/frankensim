//! fs-rep-mesh — mesh charts (plan §7.2). Layer: L2.
//!
//! - [`HalfEdgeMesh`]: manifold connectivity with boundary loops, a
//!   flip-edit core, and an invariant checker the property battery runs
//!   after every random edit;
//! - [`TetComplex`]: oriented volume elements whose signed incidence
//!   operators satisfy δδ = 0 EXACTLY (integer arithmetic) — the
//!   pre-FEEC sanity that makes fs-feec's exact sequences possible;
//! - [`TriComplex2`]: a genuine oriented 2-D complex with exact d1*d0,
//!   typed stable feature IDs, selected-side trace maps, and explicit planar
//!   or axisymmetric measure metadata;
//! - [`Soup`] + generalized winding numbers ([`winding_exact`],
//!   [`WindingOctree`]): robust inside/outside on broken input, with the
//!   dipole octree's error MEASURED against exact;
//! - [`MeshChart`]: BVH-accelerated point-triangle magnitude with a
//!   generalized-winding sign and Woop watertight raycasts; raw soup exposes
//!   `NoClaim`, no Lipschitz bound, and Estimate/NoClaim numerical evidence;
//! - [`repair`]: dedupe/degenerate/orientation/hole pipeline with
//!   structured receipts;
//! - [`dual_contour`] + [`bracket_certificate`]: bounded uniform-grid
//!   extraction and an `ExactDistance`-only, enclosure-backed whole-triangle
//!   proximity certificate with structured refusal/cancellation progress;
//! - [`shapes`]: the public mesh fixture vocabulary (cube, icosphere,
//!   deterministic corruption).

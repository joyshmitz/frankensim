//! fs-rep-mesh — mesh charts (plan §7.2). Layer: L2.
//!
//! - [`HalfEdgeMesh`]: manifold connectivity with boundary loops, a
//!   flip-edit core, and an invariant checker the property battery runs
//!   after every random edit;
//! - [`TetComplex`]: oriented volume elements whose signed incidence
//!   operators satisfy δδ = 0 EXACTLY (integer arithmetic) — the
//!   pre-FEEC sanity that makes fs-feec's exact sequences possible;
//! - [`Soup`] + generalized winding numbers ([`winding_exact`],
//!   [`WindingOctree`]): robust inside/outside on broken input, with the
//!   dipole octree's error MEASURED against exact;
//! - [`MeshChart`]: BVH-accelerated exact point-triangle distance with
//!   winding-number sign (a genuinely certified 1-Lipschitz chart) and
//!   Woop watertight raycasts;
//! - [`repair`]: dedupe/degenerate/orientation/hole pipeline with
//!   structured receipts;
//! - [`shapes`]: the public mesh fixture vocabulary (cube, icosphere,
//!   deterministic corruption).

# CONTRACT: fs-rep-mesh

## Purpose and layer
Mesh charts (plan §7.2): half-edge surfaces with an edit core, genuine
oriented 2-D triangle complexes and oriented tet complexes with
exact-arithmetic incidence (the pre-FEEC δδ = 0
sanity), generalized-winding-number robustness for polygon soup, a
BVH-accelerated signed-distance chart with watertight raycasts, and the
repair suite with structured receipts. Layer: L2. Depends on fs-geom,
fs-exec, fs-evidence, fs-alloc, fs-obs.

## Public types and semantics
- `HalfEdgeMesh` — `from_triangles` (teaching refusals: non-manifold
  edges/pinched boundary vertices — the SOUP path is the repair suite),
  boundary loops as NO_FACE half-edges, `flip_edge` (Botsch relink;
  boundary/duplicate-creating flips are non-events), `check_invariants`
  (twin involution, 3-cycles, twin-origin coherence — the property
  battery's oracle), `euler_characteristic`.
- `TetComplex` — canonical sorted edge/face tables (BTreeMap order,
  deterministic) and signed `Incidence` operators d0/d1/d2 over INTEGER
  cochains; `HexComplex` is storage-only (no-claim below).
- `TriComplex2` — an admitted oriented 2-D triangle cell complex, distinct
  from a surface half-edge mesh. It retains explicit topological dimension 2,
  embedding dimension 2, oriented face rows, canonical edges, exact integer
  d0/d1, caller-owned stable vertex keys, typed vertex/edge/face `EntityId`s,
  and prevalidated cell measures. Construction rejects malformed indices,
  payloads without a two-cell, repeated keys/cells, non-manifold or
  same-direction shared edges, non-finite coordinates, negative axisymmetric
  radii, degenerate faces, and non-representable measures. Its coordinate,
  stable-key, face, and canonical-edge tables are sealed behind read-only slice
  accessors because incidence rows, typed feature IDs, and measures are cached
  derived state; topology or embedding edits require constructing and admitting
  a new complex.
- `TriComplex2LineageId` / `TriFeatureId` — schema- and role-typed entity
  identities from `fs-blake3`. A lineage binds an exact caller-owned namespace;
  a feature binds that lineage, its topological dimension, and the canonical
  set of stable vertex keys. Storage order, coordinates, face order, and face
  orientation are deliberately not feature-identity inputs. Parsing or digest
  equality supplies no authority or provenance claim.
- `TraceMap2` / `TraceEdge2` — deterministic selected-side trace extraction.
  Exact d1 coefficients cancel selected-selected edges; selected-unselected
  edges become interface traces, and the complete face selection yields the
  outer boundary. Trace vertices and edges carry explicit parent maps and an
  exact trace-local d0.
- `Metric2::Planar` / `Metric2::Axisymmetric` — explicit measure metadata.
  Planar faces integrate area times a finite positive thickness. Axisymmetric
  coordinates are `(radius, z)` and integrate a finite positive sweep of at
  most one turn using exact linear-radius simplex quadrature; this weighting
  does not change the stored complex's topological or embedding dimension.
- `Soup` / `triangle_winding` (van Oosterom–Strackee) / `winding_exact` /
  `WindingOctree` — the Barill-style dipole hierarchy (β accuracy knob,
  area-weighted normal moments, exact leaves); octree stores indices
  only, callers pass the soup (no self-referential borrows).
- `point_triangle_distance` (Ericson region test, exact),
  `ray_triangle_watertight` (Woop permutation+shear; shared edges NEVER
  leak; exact-edge hits may double-count — documented for parity users),
  `Bvh` (median-split, deterministic tie-break by index; closest-point
  branch-and-bound + nearest-hit raycast).
- `MeshChart` — sd = BVH closest distance × winding sign. The unsigned
  distance-to-set magnitude is 1-Lipschitz, but a generic soup's winding sign
  is not topology-certified and can jump on open/self-intersecting/inconsistently
  oriented input. Raw `MeshChart` therefore retains the trait-default
  `TraceStepClaim::NoClaim`, returns `lipschitz: None`, and grades finite
  nominal samples as `Estimate` (non-finite samples as `NoClaim`) even for a
  clean-looking closed soup; `raycast` is watertight.
- `repair(soup, max_hole_edges)` — dedupe → degenerate removal →
  orientation unification (flood fill + centroid winding vote) →
  fan-fill of small boundary loops, each action a `RepairReceipt`
  (defect/location/action, the fs-io quarantine format).
- `shapes` (PUBLIC fixture vocabulary): `cube`, `icosphere`,
  deterministic `corrupt` (dups/degens/flips/hole).
- `dual_contour` / `dual_contour_clipped` / `DcOptions` /
  `bracket_certificate` — the SDF→mesh
  converter (plan §7.3 edge 2): uniform-grid dual contouring with
  explicit finite sampling-domain admission, finite positive cell spacing,
  checked corner-lattice products, and a 256-cells/axis cap before chart
  evaluation or allocation. Lattice coordinates use normalized interpolation
  over the admitted span and hit both admitted endpoints exactly, so a
  ceil-derived cell count cannot step past the admitted maximum. Cell spacing,
  QEF regularization, every nominal field sample, chart/fallback gradients,
  and all derived crossing/QEF coordinates are finite-validated. Edge secants
  scale opposite field magnitudes before division, Hermite means use convex
  online averaging, and QEF solves in cell-local coordinates, so finite
  extreme inputs either remain representable or return a structured refusal
  rather than leaking NaN/overflow into a mesh. Unbounded charts require `dual_contour_clipped`,
  which contours the geometric intersection `chart ∩ clip`, not merely a
  replacement grid extent. The converter uses
  Hermite data (secant crossings + chart gradients), regularized 3×3 QEF
  vertex placement (Schaefer mass-point regularization; `MassPoint` is
  the feature-blurring baseline), axis-uniform quad winding (cyclic
  (u,v) rings, circulation normal +d, flipped by crossing sign), and THE
  certificate: v1 accepts only the GLOBAL
  `TraceStepClaim::ExactDistance` theorem (therefore `L = 1`) and requires a
  finite rigorous `Exact`/`Enclosure` from `trace_value_enclosure` containing
  every nominal centroid evaluation. Recursive 4-way subdivision proves
  `max_abs(enclosure(centroid)) + radius ≤ tol` over the surface; local
  `ChartSample::lipschitz` values, `Estimate`, `NoClaim`, malformed evidence,
  invalid tolerances/indices, and non-representable geometry cannot produce a
  pass or fail. Completed rigorous failures localize to triangles with
  margins. `BracketCertificateError` distinguishes every refusal and
  cancellation with progress; `NoLipschitz` remains a compatibility type
  alias.
- `mesh_to_sdf` / `assess_quality` / `IncrementalMeshSdf` — the authority-graded
  mesh→SDF converter (plan §7.3 edge 1): point-triangle distance + winding sign
  sampled onto fs-rep-sdf dense grids. Edge-use, pairwise edge orientation, and
  aggregate signed-volume checks are diagnostics only: they do not certify
  per-component orientation/nesting, vertex-link manifoldness, or freedom from
  self-intersection. A disconnected soup with a large outward component and a
  smaller inward component can pass every diagnostic. Consequently every
  generic mesh payload and receipt is capped at Estimate and NAMES the
  `winding-sign-heuristic`, even when the basic screen passes. Defective inputs
  additionally record the screen's defect counts; out-of-range public soup
  indices are counted and force the screen false without being dereferenced or
  panicking. A private converter-only
  adapter supplies the unsigned distance-to-set's unit slope solely as a
  nominal reconstruction heuristic; it explicitly retains
  `TraceStepClaim::NoClaim`, forwards Estimate/NoClaim sample authority, and
  cannot authorize sphere tracing or an enclosure. Weak/NoClaim payloads remain
  NoClaim and can never be promoted by mesh quality. The QoI is the total
  abstract-distance estimate bound when available, otherwise the finite nominal
  reconstruction bound paired with a NoClaim certificate. The incremental path
  transactionally re-samples only a dirty box at exactly the original positions
  (bit-identical to full rebuild — G5); cancellation or refusal preserves the
  prior chart, field, authority, and refreshed-sample evidence as one consistent
  state. Initial and successfully edited `IncrementalMeshSdf` values apply the
  same Estimate cap before exposing their raw TiledSdf; a prior downgrade is
  never strengthened by an incremental edit.

## Invariants
1. Half-edge invariants survive 2k random flips with the Euler
   characteristic preserved (rmesh-001).
2. `point_triangle_distance` never exceeds any sampled surface distance
   and matches 1830-point brute force within sampling gap; `MeshChart`
   tracks the analytic sphere within the icosphere chord band, satisfies
   inside ⇔ sd < 0, and exhibits 1-Lipschitz behavior on that fixture
   (rmesh-002); this measurement is not a generic signed-field theorem.
   rmesh-002c locks the raw authority boundary on a clean-looking closed cube:
   default `NoClaim`, no Lipschitz bound, finite `Estimate`, non-finite
   `NoClaim`, and bracket-certificate refusal.
3. Winding classification is > 99% correct away from defects on the
   nightmare corpus (duplicates + degenerates + flipped patch + punched
   hole) — robustness on BROKEN input is the point (rmesh-003).
4. The dipole octree tracks exact winding within a measured, ledgered
   error off-surface (rmesh-004; β = 2).
5. The repair pipeline heals the corrupted corpus back to manifold,
   restores the face count and center winding, and emits receipts
   covering every defect class (rmesh-005).
6. d1∘d0 = 0 and d2∘d1 = 0 EXACTLY (integer cochains) on fixture
   complexes; axis rays through shared cube edges never leak; chart
   raycasts hit at analytic parameters (rmesh-006).
7. The converter matches analytic SDF fixtures within its recorded estimate, is
   translation-equivariant (G3), refreshes incrementally bit-identically
   (G5), keeps generic clean and defective soup at most Estimate, rejects
   mixed-component authority laundering, and never promotes weak sampled payload
   authority (rmesh-007 and focused converter unit tests).
8. Dual-contoured fixtures are manifold, closed, outward-oriented
   (winding +1 at the center — the ring-orientation law), vertex-accurate,
   translation-equivariant, bracket-certified, and the certificate DETECTS
   a fixed adversarial bad triangle with localized margins; QEF resolves the box
   corner at least twice as sharply as the mass-point baseline
   (rmesh-008).
9. Contouring admission (rmesh-009): default contouring rejects unresolved
   extended support before evaluation; the paired clipped API contours the
   actual geometric intersection; invalid spacing and checked grid-cap
   refusals also precede evaluation; every admitted positive axis has at least
   one cell even when `span / spacing` underflows, and near-integer quotients
   are incremented when their realized width would exceed the requested `h`;
   translated chart+clip pairs produce
   translated meshes with identical connectivity (G3).
10. Bracket authority (rmesh-010): `Some(1)` on a local sample cannot promote
    a `NoClaim` theorem, `Estimate`/`NoClaim` evidence, or malformed `Exact`
    evidence; a chart-requested cancellation is observed directly after the
    chart evaluation and returned with completed triangle/evaluation progress.
    Existing sphere/box exact-distance certificate coverage remains in
    rmesh-008.
11. The 2-D complex battery (rmesh-011) refuses face-less payloads rather than
    labeling a lower-dimensional object as topological dimension 2, checks
    d1∘d0 = 0 exactly over seeded admissible fans, and pins the complete square
    incidence tables. It refuses a one-face flip while a coherent global
    reversal negates d1 and boundary orientation, and matches hand-computed
    whole-boundary and selected-face trace tables. It preserves all typed IDs
    across cyclic/global orientation changes, and preserves existing vertex plus
    surviving boundary-edge IDs across append-only refinement. It reproduces
    planar and full-turn axisymmetric face/edge closed forms including a
    legitimate zero-measure axis edge. Compile-fail seals and detached-copy
    mutations prove safe callers cannot desynchronize admitted tables from
    cached incidence, identities, measures, or traces.

## Error model
Structured teaching errors (`MeshBuildError`, `TriComplex2Error`,
`Metric2Error`, `ContourError`, `BracketCertificateError`, and wrapped
`SamplingDomainError`). TriComplex2 errors retain a missing two-cell condition,
the offending cell, edge, face pair, coordinate bits, trace selection, or
canonical-identity refusal; no partial complex or feature table is published.
Contour errors
name invalid spacing/regularization, excessive resolution, checked
grid/coordinate overflow, non-finite chart samples or gradients,
non-representable derived arithmetic, cancellation, and empty zero sets.
Bracket refusals name invalid tolerance,
unsupported trace theorem, invalid indices/non-finite vertices,
non-representable geometry, malformed/non-rigorous evidence, and cancellation
progress. Total functions elsewhere (degenerate triangles yield well-defined
distances; empty-soup handling is the caller's constructor discipline). No
panics across the boundary.

## Determinism class
Deterministic: BTreeMap/BTreeSet orders, index-tie-broken BVH sorts, seeded
batteries; no clocks, no addresses in results. `TriComplex2` incidence and
trace tables are integer and storage-deterministic. Typed feature IDs are
bit-stable functions of the exact lineage ID, topological dimension, and
canonical stable-key set; admissible refinements that retain those inputs do
not move surviving IDs. Floating metric measures are deterministic exact-order
f64 evaluations on one implementation/ISA, not cross-ISA bit claims.

## Cancellation behavior
`MeshChart::eval` is bounded per query (BVH descent); batch consumers
poll between queries per the fs-geom discipline. Dual contouring polls directly
through its lattice-sampling, Hermite, vertex-placement, and stitching phases.
It also polls immediately after every chart evaluation, so a producer that
requests cancellation without polling cannot have its sample consumed.
Bracket certification polls `Cx` directly before and after each chart
evaluation (and after trace-enclosure retrieval), including recursive
subdivision, and refuses with completed triangle/evaluation progress instead
of publishing a partial verdict.
Incremental mesh-to-SDF refreshes stage all samples before committing any
chart/field state. Repair/build are bounded preprocessing passes (cancellation
hooks join with the fs-io quarantine bead where soups get large).

## Unsafe boundary
None. `unsafe_code` denied workspace-wide.

## Feature flags
None. `[S]` solid-tier.

## Conformance tests
`tests/conformance.rs` has 13 aggregate case IDs (`rmesh-001`, `rmesh-002`,
`rmesh-002b`, `rmesh-002c`, and `rmesh-003` through `rmesh-011`) covering
invariants 1–11. Every reached aggregate result is an fs-obs
`ConformanceCase` with Info/Error severity, passes `lint_failure_record`, is
serialized and wire-validated, and is printed before a failing aggregate
assertion. Assertions, expectations, and panics reached before that point are
ordinary Rust test diagnostics: they stop the case before an aggregate verdict
exists and are not laundered into synthetic evidence.

Randomized verdicts carry their literal campaign-root input seed: rmesh-001
`0x1001_2026_0706_0001`, rmesh-002 `0x1002_2026_0706_D157`, rmesh-002b
`0x1002_B026_0706_DE9E`, rmesh-003 `0x1003_2026_0706_50FA`, rmesh-004
`0x1004_2026_0706_D1B0`, rmesh-006 `0x1006_2026_0706_DD00`, rmesh-007
`0x1007_2026_0706_C0DE`, and rmesh-011 `0x1011_2026_0714_DD00`. The
rmesh-002 chart-law substream derives as campaign root xor `0xC047`, while its
canonical verdict retains the campaign root. Fixed rmesh-002c, rmesh-005,
rmesh-008, rmesh-009, and rmesh-010 use input seed zero. The fixed Cx stream
seed `0x9E54` is separate execution provenance, recorded in verdict detail and
relevant Custom companions rather than presented as input randomness.

The dipole-error, repair-receipt, mesh-conversion, and dual-contouring Custom
companions remain object-shaped, fs-obs-validated, and printed. Randomized
companions carry a standalone numeric `input_seed`; Cx-backed companions also
record the standalone numeric `execution_seed` when applicable. The
dual-contouring companion encodes an unavailable non-finite certificate margin
as JSON `null`, never as a non-JSON numeric token.

## No-claim boundaries
- Self-intersection FLAGGING is deferred to the validity-certificates
  bead (wqd.7), which owns certified broad/narrow phases via fs-ivl.
- `HexComplex` is storage only; its incidence operators land with
  fs-feec's tensor-product families.
- `TriComplex2` v1 is straight-sided and simplicial. It does not certify a
  curved-cell geometry, embedding injectivity, self-intersection freedom,
  domain topology, mesh quality, material/formulation correctness, or a 2-D
  FEEC mass matrix. The weighted-operator consumer owns those later claims.
- Stable vertex keys and lineage namespaces are caller authority. Typed feature
  hashes prevent role/schema confusion but do not prove that a key was minted
  by machine IR, that two namespaces denote the same entity, or that a
  refinement crosswalk is honest. Reindexing the convenience
  `from_indexed_triangles` constructor moves keys; durable graphs must provide
  explicit stable keys.
- Axisymmetric v1 assumes the first coordinate is nonnegative radius and uses
  the declared angular sweep. It does not certify an axis crossing, curved
  meridian interpolation, orientation of a generated 3-D body, or the physical
  applicability of an axisymmetric formulation.
- Curvature via discrete operators (cotan/normal-cycle) is deferred to
  its first consumer, with convergence-class documentation there.
- NO throughput claims (million-triangle dipole performance is the perf
  harness's); the octree's asymptotics are structural.
- The winding sign convention (+1 inside outward-oriented closed surfaces) is
  pinned by fixtures, not by a formal proof of the flux form. Generic soup has
  no component/nesting/self-intersection certificate and therefore no global
  ExactDistance promotion. Exact-edge raycast double-counting is documented.
- Attribute channels (normals/UVs/per-face data) beyond positions are
  deferred until a consumer (LUMEN materials) defines their semantics.
- The converter's incremental mode trusts the CALLER's dirty box (it
  records refreshed-sample counts for audits); automatic change-support
  inference joins with the edit-tracking half-edge attributes.
- Sparse VDB output and per-tile interval audit certificates for the
  converter join with the fs-ivl integration pass (the dense path's
  fp-envelope analysis is documented in fs-rep-sdf).
- A nominal sampled-field reconstruction bound is not abstract-region signed
  distance authority. Basic mesh quality diagnostics cannot strengthen a
  TiledSdf payload; generic mesh receipts are at best Estimate, and NoClaim
  payloads remain NoClaim and non-certifiable.
- Dual contouring is UNIFORM-GRID v1: adaptive octree contouring with
  crack-free stitching, the guaranteed-manifold MDC variant for
  ambiguous topologies, and quality post-passes (min-angle smoothing
  with certificate re-verification) are follow-ups; the fixture zoo's
  manifoldness is verified, not guaranteed for adversarial topology.
- The exact-distance centroid/radius bracket is conservative; v1 deliberately
  refuses `LipschitzImplicit` because that theorem preserves sign/zero set but
  does not provide a global Euclidean proximity upper bound. More specialized
  global theorems or fs-ivl triangle evaluation may tighten the same
  certificate surface later.

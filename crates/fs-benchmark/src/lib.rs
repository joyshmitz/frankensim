//! fs-benchmark — the wedge-vertical benchmark & trace corpus (plan addendum,
//! Proposal 7). Layer: UTIL (versioned data + measurement helpers).
//!
//! Governance Rule 2 (doctrine): "a proposal whose kill measurement was never
//! instrumented counts as killed — unmeasured survival is not survival." Many
//! addendum kill criteria measure against "the wedge vertical's benchmark set /
//! recorded traces / merge trials", yet no other bead owns that artifact. THIS
//! is the single, shared, versioned, DETERMINISTIC corpus and the fail-closed
//! evaluator-schema boundary. A declared schema does not count as
//! instrumentation until all of its typed retained evidence reconstructs.
//!
//! It bundles, for the conjugate-heat-transfer (electronics cooling) wedge:
//! a [`QueryCase`] set (QoIs, units, tolerances, and evidence-backed reference
//! answers), an optimizer [`DesignTask`] set, recorded [`EditTrace`]s with
//! retained numerator/denominator evidence, an [`MmsCase`] elliptic battery,
//! and swarm [`MergeTrial`]s. [`reconstruct_metric`] resolves typed metric
//! inputs rather than trusting detached numbers. The schema-versioned,
//! length-framed [`corpus_digest`] binds every semantic field.

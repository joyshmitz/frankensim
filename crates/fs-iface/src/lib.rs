//! fs-iface — interface types + the coupling-graph static checker (plan
//! addendum, Proposal 13). Layer: L3 (FLUX-adjacent; the FEEC periodic table
//! is a FLUX concept, but this crate is pure static analysis with no
//! numerical dependencies).
//!
//! Type every interface by its FUNCTION-SPACE role so that ill-posed
//! couplings are COMPILE-TIME errors. Arnold's FEEC periodic table is
//! literally the type lattice: `H(grad)`, `H(curl)`, `H(div)`, `L²` — the de
//! Rham complex `H(grad) --grad--> H(curl) --curl--> H(div) --div--> L²`. A
//! static [`check`] over a [`CouplingGraph`] validates every coupling against
//! an inf-sup-certified [`PairingRegistry`] BEFORE anything runs. Coupling a
//! pressure (`L²`) to a displacement trace (`H(grad)`) in an illegal pairing
//! becomes a localized rejection, not a silently garbage solve — which
//! converts the largest class of silent agent-generated nonsense into
//! compile-time errors (humans catch these by experience; agents have none).
//!
//! Two coupling ROLES are distinguished:
//! - [`CouplingRole::Continuity`] — matching the SAME field across an
//!   interface (trace continuity). Legal iff both sides live in the same
//!   trace space (an `H(div)` normal trace cannot match an `H(curl)`
//!   tangential trace).
//! - [`CouplingRole::Saddle`] — a mixed / saddle-point block pairing a trial
//!   space with a test (multiplier) space. Legality is inf-sup (LBB)
//!   stability, read from the [`PairingRegistry`].
//!
//! CONSERVATIVE BY DEFAULT (the load-bearing soundness rule): a saddle pairing
//! that is neither certified nor known-unstable is [`PairingVerdict::Unknown`]
//! and is REJECTED as illegal-until-certified — a checker that silently admits
//! pairings it does not recognize is unsound in practice.
//!
//! The registry is a DECLARATIVE literature table (LBB/inf-sup results). The
//! checker guarantees coupling-graph LEGALITY against the registry; it does
//! NOT require the corresponding saddle-point element families or solvers to
//! be implemented. Determinism: couplings are processed in order and findings
//! are emitted in order, so a replayed check reproduces the same report.

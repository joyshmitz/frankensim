//! Versioned equation-variable hypergraph and causalization-receipt schemas.
//!
//! This module is the I02.1 structural boundary between admitted Machine IR
//! and later equation extraction, matching, index reduction, and execution.
//! It records what an analyzer is allowed to consume and what a future
//! analyzer is allowed to report; it deliberately implements none of those
//! algorithms. In particular, an admitted graph or receipt does not prove
//! numerical rank, numerical nonsingularity, physical cause and effect,
//! solvability, a DAE index, or correctness of an opaque operator reference.
//!
//! Every equation and variable has a nominal, domain-separated identity
//! derived from source lineage rather than a display name or vector position.
//! Graph identity excludes diagnostic labels, canonicalizes all collections,
//! and binds the exact admitted Machine graph. Opaque sources are admitted only
//! through an explicit source identity plus a separate audit-receipt identity.

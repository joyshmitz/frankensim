//! fs-vvreg — the Gauntlet G1/G2 benchmark & V&V registry (bead
//! frankensim-ext-benchmark-vv-registry-f1gq; epic E0c). Layer: UTIL.
//!
//! A family name (TEAM, NAFEMS, CFR, IFToMM, ECN) is NOT an executable
//! benchmark. Before any solver claims a G1/G2 result against a registry
//! entry, that entry must pin: exact version/edition, source, license,
//! input-deck identity, oracle binding, QoIs, and acceptance envelopes. Citation is
//! fail-closed: [`Registry::cite`] returns a typed [`CitationRefusal`]
//! naming the first missing field instead of letting an unpinned family
//! name act as an oracle, and only the seeded registry behind
//! [`registry()`] can mint a [`CitationReceipt`] — caller-built rows and
//! registries are validation/lint-only ([`validate_entry`]).
//!
//! The registry also seeds the primary-reference table: literature and
//! standards anchors for definitions and benchmark provenance. References
//! are never authority-by-citation — no API on [`PrimaryReference`] mints
//! an evidence color; each consuming bead records its own
//! [`ConsumptionStatus`] (Appendix-D discipline) and pins the exact
//! artifact version through the entry digest.
//!
//! Color rule (encoded on [`CitationReceipt`]): a standards or benchmark
//! calculation earns at most numerical `Verified` for the exact edition and
//! scope; its physical prediction is `Estimated` unless independent
//! held-out evidence for the named QoI and population earns `Validated`.
//! No color is inherited from a publisher's name.

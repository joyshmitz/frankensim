//! Purpose-typed corpus access and calibration-taint enforcement (EXTREAL
//! E07, bead `frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.7.1`).
//!
//! A caller does not obtain a dataset by merely repeating its declared
//! partition. It must state the intended use. Training and calibration rows
//! are admitted only for [`DatasetPurpose::Calibration`] and both taint every
//! derived model; validation rows are admitted only for
//! [`DatasetPurpose::Validation`]. Blind rows additionally require a
//! generation-bound release receipt.
//!
//! All five receipt families share a closed, self-verifying wire envelope for
//! generic content-addressed persistence. This UTIL-layer module still retains
//! only an ordered in-memory partition event log; the wire envelope does not
//! claim dedicated ledger membership, audit-event atomicity, authorization, or
//! partition-state restoration.

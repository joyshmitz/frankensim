# CONTRACT: fs-vvreg

The Gauntlet G1/G2 benchmark & V&V registry (bead
frankensim-ext-benchmark-vv-registry-f1gq, epic E0c): the single place
where a benchmark family name becomes an executable claim target — or is
refused until it is one.

## Purpose and layer

Layer UTIL (versioned registry data + fail-closed citation gates). Depends
only on `fs-blake3` (domain-separated content identity) and `fs-evidence`
(`ColorRank` for the citation color caps). A family name (TEAM, NAFEMS,
CFR, IFToMM, ECN) is NOT an executable benchmark: every G1/G2 entry needs
exact version/edition, source, license, input-deck identity, oracle binding,
QoIs, and acceptance envelopes before any solver claims against it.

## Public types and semantics

- `RegistryEntry` — one row: id, tier (`RegistryTier::G1Analytic` /
  `G2Benchmark`), family, title, `Edition`, source, `LicenseState`,
  `DeckPin`, `OracleBinding`, QoIs (`Qoi` + `AcceptanceEnvelope`), notes.
  Incomplete rows may EXIST (recording a known target is honest) but
  refuse citation.
- `validate_entry` — the citation gates as a validation-only probe: it
  returns `Ok(())` or a typed `CitationRefusal` naming the first failing
  gate, in documented order: id shape/size, QoI-count cap, blank text
  fields (family, title, source, notes, QoI names/units), edition, license,
  deck, oracle binding, QoI presence, duplicate QoI names, per-QoI
  envelope pin/validity. It can never mint a receipt.
- `Registry::cite` — the ONLY receipt-minting path. It refuses
  caller-built registries (`UnauthoritativeRegistry`), refuses ambiguous
  (duplicated) ids rather than picking one of the conflicting rows, runs
  the full gate chain, and binds the resulting `CitationReceipt` to the
  seeded registry's content digest.
- `OracleBinding` — `Unpinned` targets have no pinned oracle identity or
  comparison procedure; `SelfContained` decks carry their complete closed
  form/procedure; `DerivationRequired` decks deliberately delegate a
  load-bearing derivation and stay NON-CITABLE (typed `UnboundOracle`
  refusal) until a derivation receipt mechanism binds the obligation.
- `CitationReceipt` — SEALED: private fields, no public constructor;
  holding one proves admission ran. Accessors expose entry id, tier,
  exact edition, deck digest, entry digest, registry digest, and registry
  version. Color rule lives here: `numerical_claim_cap()` is at most
  `Verified` for the exact edition and scope; `physical_claim_cap()` is
  unconditionally `Estimated` in this slice (the `Validated` upgrade
  requires a typed held-out-evidence binding, not a caller-asserted flag).
  No color is inherited from a publisher's name.
- `ConsumptionStatus` / `ConsumptionRecord` — Appendix-D discipline:
  consuming beads record unread/read/derived/reproduced/
  independently_falsified and pin the exact artifact version (the entry
  digest).
- `PrimaryReference` — the 30-entry seed of definition/provenance anchors.
  Deliberately mints no color and exposes no authority path.
- `Registry` — sorted rows + references, `lint()` (citability partition +
  seed-integrity findings: duplicate ids/keys/indices — including same key
  at different indices — and blank reference fields; duplicated ids are
  never citable), `canonical_rows()` (deterministic serialization; floats
  as IEEE-754 bit tokens), `digest()` (domain-separated, length-framed
  BLAKE3 identity), `entry_digest`.
- `registry()` — the seeded workspace registry: 12 citable G1 analytic
  entries (authored canonical specs), 6 derivation-required G1 targets
  (Geneva, Atkinson, Bennett mobility, isentropic nozzle, Sod, Lax —
  registered, non-citable until their delegated oracle/deck content is
  pinned), and 15 deliberately unpinned G2 targets.

## Invariants

- FAIL-CLOSED CITATION: an entry missing any load-bearing field (edition,
  license, deck hash, oracle, QoI, envelope) cannot be cited; the refusal
  is typed and names the field. An unpinned family name never acts as an oracle.
  Ambiguous ids and duplicate QoI names refuse; a deck that delegates its
  oracle refuses.
- SEALED RECEIPTS AND AUTHORITY: `CitationReceipt` cannot be constructed
  outside `Registry::cite`, and `cite` refuses every registry except the
  seeded one behind `registry()` (a private authority marker that public
  constructors cannot set). Synthetic rows and caller-built registries
  can be validated and linted but can NEVER reach the receipt/color-cap
  API. There is no caller-asserted evidence flag that upgrades a cap.
- MUTATION-SENSITIVE IDENTITY: every semantic field of an entry moves
  `entry_digest` (length framing, variant tags, exact IEEE-754 float
  bits). Registry input order cannot move `Registry::digest()`: rows sort
  by (id, content identity) and references by their full field tuple, so
  even conflicting duplicate-key rows land in one canonical arrangement.
- ROW/IDENTITY AGREEMENT: `canonical_row` preserves the deck variant and
  state (authored / external / malformed-external / unpinned) and uses one
  canonical hex spelling; a valid external digest is normalized to its raw
  32 bytes in the identity, so hex case cannot fork either surface. Oracle
  state (unpinned / self-contained / derivation-required) is likewise
  distinct in both the row and identity.
- NO AUTHORITY-BY-CITATION: `PrimaryReference` has no color/authority API;
  receipts cap colors, they never mint them; composition cannot upgrade
  the physical-prediction cap without independent held-out evidence.
- DERIVATION-REQUIRED DECKS: the Bennett mobility, Geneva, Sod, Lax,
  isentropic-nozzle, and Atkinson G1 targets pin their parameterization and
  mandatory limit checks while delegating a load-bearing derivation; they
  are not mnemonic-formula oracles.
- G2 seeds stay uncitable until edition/license/deck/oracle/QoIs/envelopes
  are pinned; pinning them is downstream work, not a tolerance relaxation.

## Error model

Total functions; no panics in library paths. Citation failures are
`CitationRefusal` values (recoverable, typed, actionable); consumption
binding failures are `ConsumptionRefusal`; seed-authoring defects surface
as `IntegrityFinding`s from `lint()`, not as crashes.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: all seed data is `const`; serialization renders
floats as bit tokens (never locale/formatting dependent); digests are
domain-separated BLAKE3 over length-framed canonical bytes. Bitwise
reproducible across runs, thread counts, and ISAs.

## Cancellation behavior

None; operations are synchronous with no cancellation points. Honest
cost model for caller-supplied data: `Registry::build` sorts
(`O(n log n)` comparisons over rows and references, with one content
digest per row for the canonical tie-break); `lint`/`canonical_rows`/
`digest` are linear in rows plus per-entry gate cost; the
`MAX_QOIS_PER_ENTRY` cap is checked before any QoI traversal, so QoI-count
work and the quadratic name-comparison count are capped at 64 and 64².
String byte lengths outside registry ids remain uncapped.
Enforced input caps: `MAX_QOIS_PER_ENTRY` on gate checks,
`MAX_LOOKUP_ID_LEN` plus lowercase-ASCII-slug validation on
entry validation and `Registry::cite`, and `MAX_BEAD_ID_LEN` on
`ConsumptionRecord::bind` (validated before any trim or copy).
Row/reference COUNTS are uncapped — see no-claim boundaries.

## Unsafe boundary

None. Workspace `deny(unsafe_code)` applies.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`: G1 seeds split into 12 citable receipts + 6
derivation-blocked refusals; the synthetic-forge regression (a fully
pinned synthetic row validates but no caller-built registry can mint a
receipt, and seeded receipts bind the registry digest); the bead's named
fixtures — registry lint
partition and the unpinned family-name citation refusal (TEAM 10) — plus
unknown-id refusal, duplicate-id fail-closed citation and lint exclusion,
bounded/malformed lookup-id refusal before input copies,
duplicate reference keys at non-adjacent indices, gate ordering probes
(including oracle-before-QoI and dedup-before-envelope), invalid-envelope
reasons, the canonical-row golden for the unpinned TEAM 10 row,
sorted/deterministic serialization with bit-token floats and variant-
tagged 64-hex deck digests, deck row/identity agreement (case
normalization, malformed-vs-unpinned distinction, authored-vs-external
separation), order-canonicalized registry digest, per-field mutation
sensitivity of `entry_digest` (oracle included), Appendix-D
consumption-record round trips, color-cap laws against the `ColorRank`
lattice, the complete 1..=30 primary-reference seed pinned by ordered
(key, locator) identity, and per-field reference digest mutation locks
(index, key, citation, locator, anchors, boundary each move the registry
digest).

## No-claim boundaries

- Admission proves the ENTRY is fully pinned; it does not prove any solver
  result, and it does not verify that an external deck's bytes exist or
  match their registered digest — artifact retrieval/verification is the
  consuming lane's job.
- The 15 G2 seeds are targets, not benchmarks: no claim may cite them
  until their decks are pinned (exact edition, license, deck hash, oracle,
  QoIs, acceptance data).
- G1 acceptance envelopes bound agreement with the authored analytic
  oracle under its stated assumptions; they say nothing about physical
  validity (the physical cap stays `Estimated` without held-out evidence).
- The whole-registry BLAKE3 digest golden constant is deliberately NOT
  frozen in this crate yet: per `docs/GOLDEN_POLICY.md` a golden pin
  requires committed-tree, two-mode (and where claimed, two-ISA)
  reproduction, which is scheduled with the batch-verify lane. The
  serialization goldens pin exact row strings instead.
- `ConsumptionRecord` records discipline; it does not enforce that the
  consuming bead actually read/derived/reproduced anything.
- The `Validated` physical-cap upgrade is deliberately absent: it requires
  a typed, non-forgeable binding of independent held-out evidence (future
  work tracked on the bead), not a boolean argument.
- Derivation-required entries (Bennett mobility, Geneva, Sod, Lax,
  isentropic nozzle, and Atkinson) stay non-citable until a derivation
  receipt mechanism exists; their registration is a target declaration,
  not an oracle.
- No registry-size caps: rows are compiled-in seed data here, and a
  caller-built `Registry` is the caller's resource decision —
  `build`/`canonical_rows`/`digest` do not police hostile row counts.
- A blank authored spec has no well-formed deck digest (`DeckPin::digest`
  is `None`) and renders as `{"authored":null}` — a distinct visible
  state; the entry identity still covers the raw state bytes.

//! fs-contract — assume-guarantee component contracts (plan addendum,
//! Proposal E, the ambitious half of compounding swarm memory). Layer: L3.
//!
//! A contract is `(environment envelope ⇒ guaranteed behavior, certificate)`:
//! a certified design motif ("this stiffener topology dominates in this load
//! regime, envelope attached") that a thousand agent instances can REUSE
//! without re-derivation. Contracts compose into SYSTEM claims by the
//! deliberately-primitive v1 rule — **envelope containment**: component
//! contracts compose iff each component's operating conditions, as computed by
//! the system model, provably land INSIDE its envelope (an interval-box
//! containment check, hence cheap and verified-color).
//!
//! The load-bearing soundness invariant (the Gauntlet contract-composition
//! test): a composed system claim is NEVER tighter than its weakest member's
//! certificate permits — so the composed certificate takes the WEAKEST
//! member's epistemic color ([`fs_evidence::ColorRank`]). Contracts are not
//! exempt from the type system: a NONLINEAR contract cannot carry a
//! verified-color certificate until validated per regime.
//!
//! Envelope quantities are typed by their interface function-space role
//! ([`fs_iface::SpaceType`]). Everything here is pure and deterministic.

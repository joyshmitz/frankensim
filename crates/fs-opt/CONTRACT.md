# fs-opt — CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

L4 (ASCENT). The optimization problem IR (plan §9.1): optimization
problems ARE DATA — typed objective/constraint graphs over
manifold-valued variables, storable, hashable, replayable, and
constructible INCREMENTALLY with validation at every step (the
agent-ergonomics property). The IR REPRESENTS physics and stochastic
structure; FLUX/UQ execute it.

## Public types and semantics

- `ProblemBuilder` → `Problem`: hash-consed expression arena (repeated
  subexpressions return the SAME `NodeId` — CSE by construction).
  Every constructor validates: shapes (`Scalar`/`Vector(n)`), fs-qty
  DIMENSIONS (add/compare need equal dims; mul/dot add exponents; div
  subtracts; powi scales with checked refusal rather than clamping; sqrt halves even exponents; transcendentals
  demand dimensionless), node/variable existence, parameter ranges,
  and scalar-only objective/constraint roots.
- Node kinds: arithmetic (`add/sub/mul/div/neg/powi/sqrt/exp/ln/
  tanh`), vector reductions (`dot/norm_sq/component`), kinks
  (`min/max/abs` — C0), `pde_residual` (FLUX study reference with
  ADJOINT AVAILABILITY metadata), `expectation`/`cvar`/`quantile`
  (UQ config references; CVaR/quantile are C0).
- `Class` propagation: bottom-up minimum of children and each node's
  own contribution — "this objective is non-smooth through that
  min()" is knowable at BUILD time. `Problem::route(family)` refuses
  L-BFGS/Newton on C0 graphs NAMING the poisoning node, refuses
  gradient families on adjoint-less PDE nodes NAMING the study, and
  admits subgradient/gradient-free families. `class_trace()` names
  every node's class.
- `Manifold` (`Rn`, `Sphere`, `So3` as unit quaternions, `Stiefel`)
  with `point_dim`/`tangent_dim`/`param_dim` and `retract` (Rn
  translation, Sphere normalize, SO(3) quaternion exponential,
  Stiefel Gram-Schmidt/QR) — the metadata the gradient stack
  consumes; `descend_fn`/`descend_ir` are the TOY consumers proving
  iterates stay ON their manifolds.
- Structure: multi-objective (weights), constraint KINDS (`EqZero`,
  `LeZero` — semantics/repair are fs-constraint's), `ProblemTag`
  (multi-fidelity, chance-constrained, bilevel-by-hash), `EvalBudget`
  (P4, enforced by consumers).
- Serialization: `serialize` writes the canonical six-base `fsopt v2`
  line-based text form and `parse` round-trips it BITWISE (floats travel as
  bit patterns). The reader also accepts exact legacy five-base `fsopt v1`
  bytes, mapping the absent amount exponent to `mol = 0`;
  `parse_with_version` returns the declared `WireVersion` and embedded source
  hash so a ledger-owning caller can record the required immutable
  old-hash-to-new-hash semantic-crosswalk receipt;
  `problem_hash` (in-house FNV-1a 64 over the canonical body) is the
  study identity; parsing REBUILDS through the validating builder and
  verifies the integrity hash — tampered or ill-typed files refuse
  with line numbers.
- `eval`: memoized evaluation of algebraic subgraphs; PDE/stochastic
  nodes refuse with `Unevaluable` NAMING their executor.
- `GoodhartGuard` (addendum Proposal D): treats an optimizer `Endpoint`
  (`design`, `objective`, `label`; `from_descent` bridges `DescentReport`)
  as an adversarial example. A FIXED four-step escalation ladder
  (`EscalationKind::ORDER` = rung-k+1, cross-representation, δ-perturbation,
  estimator-independence) runs pluggable `EscalationStep`s; each yields a
  `StepOutcome` (`Passed` / `Vetoed{reason}` / `NotPerformed{reason}`).
  Aggregation: any veto → `GuardStatus::Failed` (+ a `GuardFinding` the
  caller files as a tombstone/bug report); else any unregistered step →
  `Provisional`; else `Cleared`. `is_honored()` is true ONLY on `Cleared`
  — the endpoint certificate stays provisional on any skipped check (never
  a false clear). `converged_and_guard_cleared(converged, &report)` is the
  amended contract ("converged AND guard-cleared"). One concrete step ships:
  `DeltaPerturbationStep` re-evaluates a supplied objective at deterministic
  `±δ` coordinate probes and vetoes a found-better point (not a true optimum)
  or a sharp crack (optimum not in a smooth basin), failing closed on
  non-finite values.

## Invariants

1. Seeded ill-typed constructions refuse with teaching text naming
   ops/nodes, and a 600-op fuzz storm matches an independent validity
   model exactly (opt-001).
2. build→serialize→parse through canonical `fsopt v2` yields an IDENTICAL
   problem; hashes are stable across identical builds, differ across edits,
   and guard integrity. Exact five-dimension `fsopt v1` inputs remain
   readable with `mol = 0`, while v1/v2 dimension arities are otherwise
   strict (opt-002 plus focused serializer unit tests).
3. Hash-consing gives CSE identity; substitution commutes with
   evaluation BITWISE; `neg∘neg` and `min(x,x)` are bitwise identities
   (opt-003).
4. Class propagation + routing: kinks poison smooth families with the
   node named; adjoint-less PDE nodes refuse gradient families with
   the study named; the class trace covers every node (opt-004).
5. The toy Riemannian descent consumes manifold metadata: Sphere
   reaches the analytic minimizer staying unit, SO(3) aligns with a
   unit quaternion throughout, Stiefel stays orthonormal to 1e-10 and
   finds the top invariant subspace (opt-005).
6. P4/P7: the attached budget stops descent with a RECEIPT (not an
   error); cancellation returns the teaching error; PDE/stochastic
   nodes name their executor when asked to evaluate (opt-006).

## Error model

`OptError` teaching errors throughout: unknown ids, shape/dimension
mismatches and dimension overflow (with exponent vectors shown), non-dimensionless
transcendentals, odd-sqrt dims, bad parameters/indices, non-scalar
roots, `NonsmoothForFamily` (node + kind + class),
`NoAdjoint` (node + study), `Unevaluable` (node + executor), `Parse`
(line + what), `Cancelled`, `BudgetExhausted` (spent count receipt).

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: `BTreeMap` interning, index-ordered ids, bitwise
float serialization, in-house FNV hashing, no time or randomness.
Identical build sequences give identical problems, hashes, and bytes
(opt-002/003 are the trip-wires).

## Cancellation behavior

`descend_fn`/`descend_ir` poll `cx.checkpoint()` every step and
return `OptError::Cancelled` between steps. Budget exhaustion is a
RECEIPT (`budget_stopped` in the report), not an error — the iterate
remains valid (P4).

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

`parked-ir-battery` — compiles the PARKED numerics-spine draft
battery (`tests/ir_battery.rs`, see its header): it targeted a
parallel draft of this crate that lost the crate-structure race; the
draft modules (`graph.rs`, `manifold.rs`, `riemann.rs`, `sexpr.rs`,
`expr.rs`) remain in `src/` UNREFERENCED for harvest (notably: exact
reverse-mode gradients and the s-expression re-validating parser).
Off by default; nothing else is gated.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`, cases opt-001..opt-006 — JSON-line verdicts,
seeded LCG randomness, fs-obs Custom event carrying the fixture
problem hash and routing refusal. Any reimplementation must pass the
suite unchanged.

`tests/guard.rs` (Proposal D, 15 cases): no-steps→provisional-not-honored;
all-pass→cleared→honored; a veto→failed with a finding; an unregistered
step keeps the endpoint provisional (never cleared on a skipped check);
fixed step order; the amended contract needs BOTH converged and cleared;
determinism; first-registered-step-of-a-kind wins; `from_descent` bridge;
and δ-perturbation passes a smooth optimum, vetoes found-better and
sharp-crack exploits, fails closed on non-finite, and treats an empty
design as vacuously robust — plus the realistic v0 state (δ-only →
provisional).

## No-claim boundaries

- Gradients here are FD-through-retraction toys; exact adjoints and
  reverse-mode graph gradients are the gradient-stack bead (the
  parked draft's `graph.rs` already prototypes reverse-mode — harvest
  it there).
- PDE and stochastic nodes are REPRESENTED and validated, not
  executed; FLUX studies and UQ runners bind to them in their beads.
- Constraint semantics (kinds, repair, feasibility restoration) are
  fs-constraint's; this crate carries kind + name only.
- FrankenScript `ascent.optimize` lowering binds to this IR when the
  HELM surface lands.
- Bilevel tags reference inner problems by hash; inner-problem
  storage/resolution is a later bead.
- `Stiefel` descent uses ambient FD directions (overcomplete but
  convergent with the QR retraction); proper tangent bases join with
  the gradient stack.
- The Goodhart guard is the POLICY ENGINE only. Three of its four steps
  (rung-k+1, cross-representation, estimator-independence) need machinery
  that does not exist yet (the fidelity-ladder registry, a live Rep Router
  re-solve, ≥2 estimator families) and are `NotPerformed` until callers
  inject them — so a v0 endpoint clears to `Provisional`, never `Cleared`,
  by design. `GuardFinding`s are PRODUCED here (L4); writing them to the
  ledger as tombstones/bug reports is HELM's job (no upward dependency).
  The endpoint-vs-random catch-rate kill measurement (G4/statistical) is a
  Gauntlet harness bead, not this crate.

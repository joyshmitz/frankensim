//! fs-opt — the optimization problem IR (plan §9.1). Layer: L4.
//!
//! Optimization problems ARE DATA: typed objective/constraint graphs
//! over MANIFOLD-valued variables — storable, hashable, replayable,
//! and constructible INCREMENTALLY with validation at every step (the
//! agent-ergonomics property):
//!
//! - shapes and fs-qty DIMENSIONS check at build time (adding meters
//!   to square meters is refused with the nodes named);
//! - differentiability CLASS propagates bottom-up, so "this objective
//!   is non-smooth through that min()" is known before any optimizer
//!   runs, and [`Problem::route`] refuses the wrong family with the
//!   poisoning node named;
//! - PDE constraints (`physics(u, θ) = 0`) and stochastic operators
//!   (expectation / CVaR / quantile over UQ configs) are FIRST-CLASS
//!   nodes carrying adjoint/config metadata — the IR represents them,
//!   FLUX/UQ execute them;
//! - manifolds carry retraction metadata ([`Manifold::retract`]) that
//!   a toy Riemannian descent consumes — orientations optimize as
//!   orientations;
//! - canonical serialization round-trips bitwise (floats travel as bit
//!   patterns); admitted semantic identity and exact wire identity are
//!   domain-separated BLAKE3 values, while the legacy FNV-64 body hash
//!   remains a quarantined correlation/corruption tripwire only;
//!   parsing REBUILDS through the validating builder, so tampered
//!   files cannot smuggle ill-typed graphs.

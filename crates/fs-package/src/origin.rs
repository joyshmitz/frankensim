//! CLAIM ORIGINS (schema v6): where a claim's certificate
//! CAME FROM — the missing half of "machine-checkable".
//!
//! Schema v4 made the content address collision-resistant, but content
//! consistency is not evidence origin: `Color::Verified { lo, hi }` is
//! public algebra (fs-evidence composition needs it), so any producer
//! could mint a finite interval and the standalone checker would pass
//! it. v5 sealed claims AT THE PACKAGE BOUNDARY; v6 additionally makes
//! every external trust decision an explicit, fingerprinted capability.
//! Every claim must carry
//! a [`ClaimOrigin`] consistent with its color, bound into the content
//! address, and re-derivable by the checker — while the Color algebra
//! itself stays public and untouched.
//!
//! The five origins and their re-derivation obligations:
//! - [`ClaimOrigin::SourceCertificate`] — a named producer plus the
//!   64-hex content hash of its certificate artifact (solver
//!   certificate, proof object). Shape is checked locally; a positive
//!   verdict requires an injected [`SourceCertificateVerifier`] to
//!   establish the exact typed claim request. The artifact hash makes
//!   the certificate subpoenable without shipping it.
//! - [`ClaimOrigin::AnchoredSource`] — a validated claim's reference
//!   dataset by id + content hash; must MATCH the color's named
//!   dataset exactly and be accepted by an injected
//!   [`AnchoredSourceVerifier`] over the exact claim and regime.
//! - [`ClaimOrigin::EstimatedSource`] — the estimator identity; must
//!   match the color's estimator string exactly.
//! - [`ClaimOrigin::Derived`] — a composition receipt; the checker
//!   re-runs `compose` over the parents and the result must equal the
//!   claimed color bit-exactly (the v3 receipt machinery, now the
//!   origin itself). A derived `Validated` claim must also carry a matching
//!   dataset anchor, and every matching anchor is independently admitted by
//!   [`AnchoredSourceVerifier`]; the derivation verifier cannot authorize it.
//! - [`ClaimOrigin::AuthenticatedWaiver`] — an explicit, expiring,
//!   MAC'd grant. NEVER self-authorizing: verification requires an
//!   INJECTED [`WaiverVerifier`] capability plus a date context; the
//!   in-tree default refuses everything (the fs-ledger fail-closed
//!   pattern). The MAC binds the claim's canonical bytes, so a waiver
//!   replayed onto a different claim fails.

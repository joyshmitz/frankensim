//! fs-voi — value-of-information and active validation. Layer: L4.
//!
//! The strategic layer deciding WHAT INFORMATION TO ACQUIRE NEXT. The whole
//! point is the ESTIMATOR-vs-DECISION distinction: spend compute where it can
//! CHANGE A DECISION (flip which design ranks first), not merely where an
//! estimator is uncertain. A design that is wildly uncertain but clearly last
//! is not worth another cent.
//!
//! Each design's objective is an Evidence-carrying estimate: a mean plus an
//! [`Uncertainty`] with NUMERICAL, STATISTICAL, and MODEL-form components. The
//! decision is "which design minimizes the objective". Over that:
//! - [`ranking_flip_probability`] — `P(a runner-up is actually better)`;
//! - [`expected_opportunity_loss`] — the FULL multi-alternative expected
//!   opportunity loss of the current decision (the ceiling on what any
//!   information is worth): EVERY alternative participates, so a
//!   worse-mean/large-variance third design cannot be silently dropped;
//! - [`top_two_evpi_surrogate`] — the cheap two-design closed form, kept ONLY
//!   as an action-ranking surrogate; it must never gate a global robustness
//!   claim;
//! - [`action_value`] — how much a menu action (surrogate / simulate / sample /
//!   test / refine) REDUCES the surrogate EVPI, per unit cost. An action on a
//!   decision-IRRELEVANT design is worth ~0;
//! - [`recommend`] — the best action, or STOP when the decision is already
//!   robust (the STOP gate is the FULL evaluator, never the surrogate);
//! - [`heuristic_choice`] — the uncertainty-proportional baseline VOI must beat
//!   ([M] discipline).
//! - [`recommend_unknown_resolutions`] — attach cost-aware information actions
//!   to the exact unknowns that keep an `fs-evidence` requirement verdict
//!   indeterminate, while preserving an explicit unpriced fallback.
//!
//! Deterministic; the decision algebra uses an in-house normal CDF and the
//! requirement adapter depends only on the lower-layer `fs-evidence` types.

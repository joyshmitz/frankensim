//! fs-thrust-e2e — CertQD-Thrust: SCREENED quality-diversity discovery of
//! self-propelling point-vortex thrusters. Layer: L6 (HELM orchestration).
//!
//! "Cert" names the discipline, not the claim: every drift this crate publishes
//! is `Estimated`. Nothing here is interval-certified — see [`screen_full_drift`].
//!
//! # The campaign (the raison d'être, exercised end to end)
//!
//! Classical CFD shape optimization returns ONE design after a hand-tuned run.
//! This instead ILLUMINATES the whole diverse family of vortex configurations
//! that translate themselves through an inviscid fluid — and it does so with
//! FrankenSim's actual differentiators wired together:
//!
//! - **Physics** ([`fs_vpm`]): a "thruster" is a four-vortex quadrupole (a
//!   leading `±Γ` dipole and a trailing `±Γ·ratio` dipole). Total circulation is
//!   zero by construction, so the cluster is a generalized dipole: it TRANSLATES
//!   (the vortex mean position drifts) while its linear impulse is conserved.
//!   The two dipoles interact nonlinearly — the drift is NOT analytic and must
//!   be simulated (RK4 desingularized Biot–Savart).
//! - **Screening** ([`fs_evidence`]): a point-vortex system conserves the exact
//!   LINEAR IMPULSE `I = (Σ Γᵢ yᵢ, −Σ Γᵢ xᵢ)`. A full sim that leaked impulse is
//!   not trustworthy, so the campaign SCREENS on that residual — and reports the
//!   screen for exactly what it is. Conservation of `I` bounds nothing about the
//!   mean-`x` drift (for a zero-total-circulation quadrupole the drift is not
//!   even a component of `I`), and [`fs_vpm::simulate`] is unchecked RK4 with no
//!   step-size control, so NO drift here is `Verified`: every drift is
//!   `Estimated`, and the screened ones carry their impulse residual as the
//!   estimator's dispersion. A residual is a diagnostic, not an enclosure (bead
//!   `frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.2.30`).
//! - **Fidelity management** ([`fs_surrogate`]): a cheap SHORT-horizon sim is a
//!   surrogate for the expensive FULL-horizon sim. A split-conformal band is
//!   calibrated on (short vs full) residuals; then `certify_or_escalate` uses the
//!   short estimate only for designs inside the calibration set's PER-AXIS
//!   support — every gene the calibration pinned or varied, not just the two
//!   descriptor axes — when the band is decision-relevant, and ESCALATES to a
//!   full sim otherwise. Whether that saves integration steps is arithmetic, not
//!   a promise: the served designs must repay the paired calibration sims (see
//!   [`CampaignReport::steps_spent`]).
//! - **Illumination** ([`fs_archive`]): a MAP-Elites archive over (circulation
//!   budget × device length) keeps the best-translating configuration in every
//!   behavioral niche — the diverse Pareto atlas, not a single optimum.
//! - **Claim governance** ([`fs_govern`]): the public long-horizon drift claim
//!   routes through E09 to the statistical-observable/model-evidence machinery
//!   it would need. The retained route is provenance, not evidence that those
//!   capabilities ran, so every current RK4 drift remains `Estimated`.
//! - **Provenance** ([`fs_report`]): the campaign emits a deterministic,
//!   content-addressed lab notebook carrying the reproducing IR.
//!
//! Everything is deterministic (a fixed design grid, no RNG) — the Five
//! Explicits: units (Γ, lengths, steps), seed, budgets, versions, capabilities.
//! Ambition: `[F]` frontier synthesis; the physics is a 2-D inviscid smoke tier.

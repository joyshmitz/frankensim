//! fs-solid — the elasticity core (plan §8.2, bead tfz.13): linear
//! elasticity through finite-strain hyperelasticity with a measured
//! locking-free path, on BOTH the body-fitted and the CutFEM-on-SDF
//! frontends (topology optimization solves THIS physics on octrees).
//!
//! Layer: L3. Constitutive laws live in fs-material (energies, exact
//! AD stresses, consistent tangents); this crate owns KINEMATICS,
//! WEAK FORMS, and NEWTON LOOPS:
//! - [`mesh2`]: structured 2D body-fitted meshes — P1 triangles, Q1
//!   quads, and mapped quadrilateral panels (Cook's membrane).
//! - [`linear`]: plane-strain/plane-stress small-strain elasticity;
//!   standard displacement elements plus the B-BAR dilatation
//!   projection (the measured locking-free formulation).
//! - [`hyper2d`]: plane-strain finite-strain hyperelasticity through
//!   fs-material cards (Neo-Hookean, Mooney–Rivlin): exact residuals
//!   and consistent tangents from the 3D deformation gradient,
//!   Newton with backtracking line search and load stepping.
//! - [`cutfront`]: the CutFEM frontend — vector Q1 on fs-cutfem
//!   background quadtrees, symmetric Nitsche displacement conditions,
//!   componentwise ghost penalty.
//!
//! Element-selection guidance (fs-regime's structural indicators feed
//! these thresholds): [`select_formulation`] returns B-bar whenever
//! near-incompressibility (ν ≥ 0.45) or bending domination
//! (slenderness ≥ 5) threatens locking — the conformance battery
//! MEASURES the standard element's failure on exactly those regimes.
//! TDNNS-proper (normal-normal-stress continuity) awaits the
//! simplicial H(div)-family bead and is a recorded no-claim.

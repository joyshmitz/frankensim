//! fs-probe — discrepancy probes + the budget pie (plan addendum, Proposal 3).
//! Layer: L3. Makes the THIRD epistemic color (`estimated`) actually
//! COMPUTABLE, and makes model-form error visible.
//!
//! Two mechanisms:
//!
//! 1. **Adjacent-rung discrepancy probes.** Given the shared fidelity-ladder
//!    registry ([`fs_ladder`]), evaluate the same design on two ADJACENT rungs,
//!    prolongate the coarse solution onto the fine rung, and take the
//!    difference: `|fine − prolongate(coarse)|` per subdomain is a MEASURED,
//!    LOCALIZED model-form error field. It is stored **estimated-color** (an
//!    [`fs_evidence::Color::Estimated`] with the probe as estimator and its
//!    dispersion). Humans never do this systematically because it is tedious;
//!    a swarm does it overnight.
//!
//! 2. **The budget pie.** Aggregate a result's error contributions BY COLOR:
//!    verified (interval-certified numerics ≈ discretization/mesh error),
//!    validated (regime-anchored), estimated (model-form: closure/surrogate).
//!    The pie tells the operator where the error budget is ACTUALLY spent — so
//!    "refine the mesh" is never prescribed when the budget says "your closure
//!    is the problem". This is the single most operator-legible artifact of the
//!    whole epistemic type system.
//!
//! Probe compute is bounded by a [`ProbeBudget`] (a HARD ceiling as a fixed
//! fraction of the fleet budget). Everything here is a pure, deterministic
//! function of its inputs (no RNG, no I/O), so probe fields and budget pies are
//! bit-reproducible on replay.

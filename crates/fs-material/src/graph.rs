//! The executable ConstitutiveGraph and law-node protocol (bead kagp,
//! increment 1).
//!
//! Matter is a typed constitutive graph, not a bag of scalars. The
//! seven-role decomposition is load-bearing: (1) topology/balance and
//! (2) bulk storage/metric are OWNED ELSEWHERE (fs-feec/fs-rep-mesh) —
//! this graph can reference them as external roles but refuses to
//! execute them; (3) bulk transport/dissipation, (4) reversible/
//! cross-coupled blocks, (5) interface laws, (6) reaction/source, and
//! (7) internal memory are executable law nodes here.
//!
//! Every node DECLARES its ports (name + dims), state schema,
//! calibration domain, differentiability class, energy/dissipation
//! behavior, and whether it claims a consistent tangent — and admission
//! refuses nodes whose declarations are incomplete or whose claims
//! probe false, with typed diagnostics naming the node, the law, and
//! the failed obligation. Implementations are keyed by the immutable
//! L1 fs-matdb (LawId, LawVersion) identity and instantiated from
//! validated `ConstitutiveModelCard`s — fs-material CONSUMES the card
//! metadata, never redefines it.

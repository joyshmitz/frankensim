# CONTRACT: fs-surrogate

Learned accelerators with guarantees: surrogates permitted only inside certified
validity bands — ML proposes, certified numerics disposes.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L4 (surrogate / ROM). The default core is dependency-free and pure Rust
(an in-house symmetric eigensolver for the method of snapshots); the optional
ladder feature depends downward on `fs-evidence`, `fs-blake3`, `fs-exec`,
`fs-alloc`, and asupersync for evidence, content identity, bounded tile
execution, memory admission, and live task cancellation.

## Public types and semantics

- `pod(&[Vec<f64>], energy_threshold) -> Result<Pod, SurrogateError>` — a POD
  reduced-order model via the method of snapshots (correlation matrix `SᵀS`,
  symmetric eigendecomposition, modes `φₖ = Svₖ/σₖ`), retaining the fewest modes
  capturing `energy_threshold` of the mean-centered energy.
- `Pod` — `rank`, `energy_captured`, `project`, `reconstruct`,
  `reconstruction_error` (the reduced-vs-full error).
- `conformal_band(residuals, alpha) -> ConformalBand` — the distribution-free
  split-conformal band (the `⌈(1−α)(n+1)⌉`-th smallest residual); `covers`,
  `half_width`. `empirical_coverage(&ConformalBand, &[(pred, truth)])`.
- `certify_or_escalate(&ConformalBand, in_validity_domain, decision_tolerance)
  -> Decision` — `UseSurrogate` iff inside the domain AND the band is at least as
  tight as the decision tolerance, else `Escalate`.
- Root `SurrogateError` — `NoSnapshots` / `DimMismatch` / `BadThreshold`.

- `ladder` module (addendum Proposal A, bead knh1.4; [F], behind
  `abstraction-ladder`): a bounded abstraction ladder whose present
  authority is ESTIMATED, not certified. `TruthModel` defines the P1
  full-order elliptic family's DECLARED level-0 semantics; its f64 solve
  is not an enclosure. `RbLevel` uses offline snapshots, an
  energy-orthonormal basis, and online Galerkin evaluation of the
  textbook residual/coercivity a-posteriori estimator. `ConceptLevel`
  uses interpolation with total dispersion calibrated at finite probes
  as `|concept − lower RB| + lower RB QoI estimator`; admission also
  evaluates that quantity at the actual query and takes the larger value.
  `Ladder::at_level(k)?.query(μ, tol)` performs AUTOMATIC BOUNDED
  DESCENT: an RB/concept rung answers only when its estimator is within
  tolerance; otherwise the leak is recorded and the query descends.
  `ladder::SurrogateError` names all ladder refusals. `RbCoveragePlan`
  retains the exact ordered battery, schema/algorithm version, and a
  domain-separated content fingerprint of the truth family and every RB basis
  value. `rb_coverage_scoped`
  executes one logical parameter tile per μ and returns a complete Estimated
  fraction or an incomplete no-claim plus deterministic prefix/progress
  receipt. `rb_coverage` remains the smaller synchronous compatibility oracle.

## Invariants

- POD reproduces an exactly-representable (low-rank) snapshot set to roundoff;
  its modes are orthonormal; the retained rank captures `>= energy_threshold`.
- The conformal band achieves at least its nominal `(1−α)` empirical coverage on
  exchangeable held-out data.
- `certify_or_escalate` uses the surrogate ONLY when trustworthy (in-domain +
  band tight enough), so a fleet of queries costs strictly less than
  all-high-fidelity whenever any query is served by the surrogate.
- Every ladder-emitted color is `Estimated` and passes the shared
  `fs-evidence` payload validator. RB answers carry the f64-evaluated
  QoI estimator as dispersion; concept answers carry the larger of the probe
  maximum and query-local cross-rung discrepancy PLUS lower-rung QoI
  dispersion, so agreement with an inaccurate RB cannot erase its
  uncertainty. Level 0 carries
  infinite dispersion because an unproved floating-point solve makes no
  spread claim.
- Ladder state is sealed. Truth dimension, training range, basis,
  calibrated dispersion, rung collection, family identity, and answer
  evidence cannot be mutated or forged through public fields. Every rung
  is bound to one identity containing the truth dimension and exact
  floating-point range endpoints.
- Public ladder arithmetic and lookup operations are fallible. Queries
  reject non-finite/non-coercive/out-of-range inputs before lookup, and
  generated training/probe grids must be strictly increasing in f64.
- Ladder construction preflights nonempty, capped, strictly decreasing
  requested RB dimensions plus checked aggregate memory/work budgets
  before the first snapshot. After orthogonalization, actual retained
  dimensions must also strictly decrease before a rung is stored.
  Coverage batteries are nonempty and capped on both axes, their Cartesian
  product, and conservative aggregate work. Each parameter performs at most
  one descent (including at most one truth fallback), and the resulting RB
  estimators classify every requested tolerance without repeating solves.
- Production coverage validates and retains exact IEEE-754 input bits, rung
  dimensions, family, numerical-ladder fingerprint, Cartesian count, and a
  conservative work envelope that dominates the same logical units recorded by
  the kernel meter before execution.
  The caller supplies a coverage-scoped or cap-compatible bounded
  `OperationMemoryLease` whose hard limit is at most 512 MiB. A worst-case
  coverage-owned scratch charge is reserved before slots or workers are
  created; TilePool root metadata and arena chunks charge the same lease, so
  their combined tracked live set cannot exceed that limit. Results commit to
  unique parameter slots only after their final checkpoint; final aggregation
  is ascending by parameter index and ignores out-of-order completions beyond
  the first gap. Kernel and slot storage are destroyed before the matching
  scratch charge is released. Exact battery axes are immutable shared slices
  allocated when the caller constructs the plan; the receipt shares those
  slices instead of copying their payload into run-local scratch.
- Incomplete coverage cannot expose a fraction through its type. Its receipt
  contains only the longest fully committed parameter prefix and the first
  unfinished parameter's operational progress, together with an absorbing
  `NumericalCertificate::no_claim()`. Coverage outcomes are opaque: callers
  have read-only complete/incomplete accessors and cannot construct arbitrary
  coverage, authority, no-claim, or finalization evidence. Worker-dependent
  coverage-owned scratch declarations remain run diagnostics and never enter
  the semantic receipt. They exclude separately charged TilePool metadata and
  arena chunks; the returned cumulative lease snapshot records the shared
  accounting state and can include other users of a cloned lease.

## Error model

Structured `SurrogateError`. Ladder construction, energy, compliance,
training, lookup, level selection, querying, and coverage return named
errors for invalid shapes/values/ranges/grids, singular or non-finite
derived arithmetic, resource excess, exact lease refusal, and structured
allocator/executor failure. Cooperative cancellation returns the drained partial
run/receipt; numerical and executor errors return their typed error after
drain but do not currently claim a replay receipt. The non-ladder conformal
helper still panics on nonsensical inputs (empty residuals, `α ∉ (0,1)`).

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic for synchronous work. A completed scoped coverage outcome,
including its finalized semantic receipt, is bit-identical across worker counts
and steal schedules because each parameter has a unique slot and final integer
aggregation is in parameter order. The semantic receipt excludes timing, steal,
and worker-dependent scratch data. With one worker, an explicitly
injected cancellation at the same logical checkpoint replays the same retained
prefix. Shared task-budget consumption and wall-time cancellation under
multiple workers are schedule-dependent; any resulting prefix remains
operational no-claim evidence rather than a deterministic scientific result.

## Cancellation behavior

The POD/conformal API and `rb_coverage` compatibility wrapper remain
synchronous; `rb_coverage` has the explicit smaller
`MAX_SYNCHRONOUS_COVERAGE_WORK_UNITS` cap and no interruption claim.

`rb_coverage_scoped` requires a live asupersync `Cx`, `TilePool`, external
`CancelGate`, declared `RunId`/per-tile `Budget`, and a bounded operation memory
lease whose hard limit does not exceed 512 MiB. It polls both the tile gate and
ambient task at every parameter/rung
phase boundary and after at most 256 logical scalar updates inside allocation
initialization, validation, assembly, Thomas solves, dense elimination,
reconstruction, residual/Riesz work, and tolerance classification. A request
raises the shared gate, all workers drain and join, scratch is released, and
only then is an incomplete no-claim returned. A final ambient checkpoint occurs
after drain, followed by an external gate read before a coverage fraction can
be published. Because both request sources are monotone, a successful call can
linearize at the earlier final ambient checkpoint; either observation can still
force an incomplete outcome.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

- `abstraction-ladder` [F] (default OFF) — the estimated, leak-alarmed
  abstraction ladder (knh1.4/y6yv, Proposal A; `dep:fs-evidence`,
  `dep:fs-blake3`,
  `dep:fs-exec`, `dep:fs-alloc`, `dep:asupersync`); gates the `ladder`
  integration target.

## Conformance tests

`tests/surrogate.rs` (9 cases): POD reproduces a low-rank set exactly;
orthonormal modes; energy-based rank + reduced error; bad-input rejection; the
conformal band achieves nominal coverage; certify-or-escalate uses the surrogate
only when trustworthy; the policy reduces cost vs all-high-fidelity;
determinism.

`tests/ladder.rs` (feature-gated): f64 RB estimator containment on the
elliptic fixture, bounded descent, Estimated-only payload authority,
deterministic replay, structured hostile-input refusals, representable
grid and family binding, requested/retained fidelity descent,
lower-rung uncertainty inheritance, pre-training memory/work limits,
bounded coverage batteries, complete scoped replay across worker counts,
content-bound plans, work-envelope/meter agreement, pre-cancel and
external-gate cancellation, deterministic logical-work storms across worker
counts, nonzero single-worker retained-prefix replay, final-publication refusal,
bounded observation latency, unbounded/over-cap/undersized lease refusal,
memory/arena quiescence, and successful pool reuse.

## No-claim boundaries

- v0 is the CLASSICAL ROM core (POD via method of snapshots) + the conformal /
  certify-or-escalate guardrail. NEURAL OPERATORS (Fourier neural operators,
  DeepONets via FrankenTorch), DEIM nonlinear-term interpolation, BALANCED
  TRUNCATION for LTI subsystems, and KOOPMAN/DMD are the fuller deliverable,
  staged.
- The eigensolver is a small dense Jacobi for the snapshot correlation matrix;
  the production path is fs-la randomized/TSQR SVD over large snapshot matrices.
- The conformal band is SPLIT-conformal (exchangeable data); the anytime-valid
  e-value formulation with online recalibration under drift is the
  conformal-hardening follow-on.
- Continuous training from the ledger, versioned/model-carded surrogate
  artifacts, and design-family-respecting splits are downstream integrations.

## No-claim boundaries (ladder)

- The beachhead covers the AFFINE-PARAMETRIC ELLIPTIC regime (1-D
  fixture family here); nonlinear/transient coarse levels are the
  research frontier and enter only as estimated-color concept rungs.
- Level 0 is the declared FE semantics, but neither floating-point solve
  error nor FE discretization error is enclosed here. Its Estimated
  color therefore has infinite dispersion; there is no zero-error claim.
- The RB residual/Riesz/solve path is evaluated in round-to-nearest f64
  without outward rounding or independent linear-solve certificates.
  Its textbook estimator is useful and tested for containment on this
  fixture, but it does not authorize `Color::Verified` and descent is not
  called certified.
- Compliance dispersion includes both the squared energy estimator and the
  floating reduced solve's computable Galerkin defect
  `|f(u_rb) - a(u_rb,u_rb)|`; exact orthogonality is never assumed.
- The concept rung's dispersion is a finite-probe MAXIMUM of
  `|concept − lower RB| + lower RB QoI estimator`, augmented by the same
  query-local quantity. Neither is an enclosure over the continuous range.
  The Estimated color is load-bearing.
- The synchronous `rb_coverage` helper is only a small compatibility oracle and
  makes no interruption claim. Production-scale authority requires
  `rb_coverage_scoped` and its explicit execution/memory inputs.
- Scoped coverage's static declaration covers its bounded coverage-owned
  vector, matrix, and progress-slot scratch. Executor root metadata and arena
  chunks are separately charged to the same at-most-512-MiB lease, so the hard
  limit bounds their combined tracked execution-phase live set. The returned
  lease receipt is cumulative when the caller shares or clones that lease; it
  is not an isolatable per-run heap census. Retained output payloads, thread
  stacks, allocator bookkeeping, the immutable pre-existing ladder, and OS
  scheduling latency remain outside the numerical claim. A callback or
  dependency that ignores its supplied cancellation protocol would likewise be
  outside claim; the current sealed arithmetic path does not do so.
- The task-scoped executor contains per-tile kernel panics, but an OS refusal
  while asupersync creates a scoped worker or a worker failure outside tile
  containment follows the executor's documented panic boundary. No structured
  coverage artifact is claimed for that executor-invariant failure.
- A completed coverage fraction still classifies round-to-nearest f64 RB
  estimators. It is `Estimated` with infinite dispersion, never a certificate
  that the continuous model error lies below the requested tolerances.
- The eventual certificate destination is an outward-rounded residual,
  Riesz solve, reduced solve, coercivity floor, and QoI enclosure whose
  complete arithmetic path is independently checkable. Only that path,
  once admitted by the Gauntlet, may upgrade a rung to `Verified`.
- Per-REGION (spatial) RB decomposition and the fs-ir at_level query
  integration are the named growth seams.

//! THE ABSTRACTION LADDER (addendum Proposal A, bead knh1.4; [F] —
//! behind the `abstraction-ladder` feature): reduced-order VIEWS at
//! multiple abstraction levels whose fidelity to the level below is a
//! QUANTIFIED, leak-alarmed estimator — the operator reasons at the concept
//! level until the estimator says the abstraction is no longer faithful
//! HERE, and drills down only there.
//!
//! THE BEACHHEAD: REDUCED-BASIS for the affine-parametric elliptic
//! family `−(a(x;μ) u′)′ = f` with `a = 1 + μ·χ` — offline snapshots +
//! energy-orthonormal basis + online k×k Galerkin, and the TEXTBOOK
//! a-posteriori bound `‖u−u_rb‖_a ≤ ‖r‖_{V′}/√α_LB` with the residual
//! dual norm assembled offline and the coercivity floor exact for the
//! affine family. The compliance QoI estimator retains both the classic
//! squared energy estimator and the floating reduced solve's computable
//! Galerkin defect.
//!
//! EVIDENCE HONESTY (bead y6yv): every color this module emits is
//! ESTIMATED. The RB bound is real mathematics over the reals, but it
//! is COMPUTED here in round-to-nearest f64 with no outward rounding,
//! no Riesz-solve error control, and no linear-solve certificate — a
//! textbook bound evaluated in floating point is NOT an executable
//! enclosure, so it cannot mint `Color::Verified`. Likewise level 0 is
//! the DECLARED FE truth semantics, but its Thomas solve is plain
//! floating point: a point value under declared semantics, not a
//! verified interval. The certified-ladder DESTINATION (outward-rounded
//! residual/Riesz/solve certificates upgrading these colors to
//! Verified) is recorded in the CONTRACT as future scope; the type
//! system keeps today's estimates from impersonating it.

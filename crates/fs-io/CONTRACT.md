# fs-io — CONTRACT

Import/export with QUARANTINE (plan patch Rev J): the world boundary.
Dirty geometry comes in, useful artifacts go out — and no imported
artifact becomes a trusted value without a certification receipt.

Ambition tags: STL/OBJ/PLY + quarantine + catalogs + 3MF/GLB/VTK [S];
bounded STEP Part-21 syntax kernel [S]; CAD/EXPRESS interpretation,
tessellation, and B-rep interchange explicitly STAGED (no-claim below).

## Purpose and layer

Layer **L2** (MORPH). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-rep-mesh (repair +
half-edge validity), fs-evidence, fs-geom, fs-obs, fs-math. PNG/EXR
export is fs-img's (L5). Ledger `imports` rows are written HELM-side
from the receipt JSON this crate emits — L2 never calls L6. Consumers:
the P4 frame flagship (AISC catalogs), fs-fab.

## Public types and semantics

- **Imports** (`stl`, `obj`, `ply` modules): binary STL (auto-detected
  by exact sizing, so binary files beginning with "solid" still parse)
  + ASCII STL; OBJ subset (`v`/`f`, fan triangulation, negative indices,
  `v/vt/vn` forms with vt/vn ignored); PLY ASCII + binary_little_endian
  (vertex x/y/z any scalar type, face index lists; other
  elements/properties skipped with correct stride accounting). Every
  parser: element-capped (`MAX_ELEMENTS`), length-checked, non-finite
  coordinates refused, structured `IoError` — never a panic.
- **Quarantine** (`quarantine` module): `import_mesh` → `Quarantined
  { raw, source_receipt, defects }`. The census detects degenerate
  faces, duplicate faces, unreferenced vertices, and non-manifold-or-
  open surfaces — the latter by DIRECT EDGE COUNTING (every undirected
  edge of a watertight 2-manifold appears exactly twice) because the
  half-edge builder alone legally accepts open boundaries (a real trust
  gap the conformance suite caught during development). `promote` runs
  the fs-rep-mesh repair suite, re-censuses, and either yields
  `Evidence<Soup>` (exact numerics, receipt-chained provenance) plus the
  `trust: promoted` receipt JSON, or a `PromotionRefusal` with blocking
  defects, ACTIONABLE fixes, and a `trust: refused` receipt.
- **Exports** (`export` + format modules): binary STL / OBJ / ASCII PLY
  (deterministic; OBJ and PLY carry f64 shortest-round-trip text, exact
  on re-import); 3MF (minimal OPC ZIP with STORED entries, fixed
  timestamps for byte determinism); GLB (glTF 2.0 binary container,
  f32 positions + u32 indices, chunk-accounted); legacy-ASCII VTK
  unstructured grid with optional scalar point field.
- **Catalogs** (`catalog` module): CSV (RFC-4180 subset with quoted
  fields and `""` escapes) and JSON (minimal array-of-flat-objects
  reader) validated against a `Schema` of `ColumnSpec`s (Text /
  bounded Number, required flags). Violations name the 1-based data
  row, column, offending text, and the expectation; missing header
  columns list what WAS found.
- **STEP structure** (`step` module): bounded, ASCII-only parsing of the
  ISO-10303-21 clear-text envelope, mandatory `FILE_DESCRIPTION`,
  `FILE_NAME`, and `FILE_SCHEMA` header records, simple and complex DATA
  instances, aggregates, typed parameters, strings, enumerations,
  numeric tokens, and forward references. Parsing rejects duplicate or
  dangling instance IDs after the whole DATA section is known. Canonical
  writing sorts instances by numeric ID, preserves parameter/component
  order, doubles string apostrophes, and revalidates caller-constructed
  documents before emitting bytes. `require_declared_schema` supplies an
  exact, case-insensitive declaration gate without treating a schema label
  as conformance evidence. The sealed `ParsedStep` keeps its immutable
  receipt from becoming stale; `StepStructureReceipt` records syntax/crate
  versions, exact admission limits, non-cryptographic source/canonical-layout
  FNV fingerprints, schemas, graph counts, and a strictly non-authoritative
  AP203/AP214 label hint. HELM must replace fingerprints with its
  collision-resistant artifact identity before authority-bearing use.

## Invariants

1. **Round-trip fidelity per format**: OBJ and PLY re-import bitwise-
   identical f64 positions; STL agrees to f32 precision (documented
   lossy: positions only, welded by exact coordinate match, normals
   recomputed).
2. **No import is trusted without promotion**: the census runs on every
   import; promotion refuses while blocking defects remain, and both
   outcomes emit ledger-ready receipt JSON with the source hash, parser
   version, defect census, and trust status.
3. **Hostile input never panics**: 13.5k byte-mutants, all truncation
   prefixes, and pure junk across all three formats produce structured
   results (CI-checked fuzz lane).
4. **Deterministic exports**: identical soups produce identical bytes
   (fixed ZIP timestamps, fixed chunk layout).
5. **Schema errors teach**: row + column + offender + expectation.
6. **Part-21 graph integrity**: instance IDs are positive and unique;
   forward references are permitted but every reference must resolve by
   end of DATA; mandatory header records occur exactly once and in the
   supported order.
7. **Part-21 resource bounds**: input/output bytes, tokens, instances,
   values, nesting, encoded strings, number tokens, identifiers,
   complex-instance components, and schema-count each have an explicit
   nonzero cap. Recursive nesting also has an implementation hard ceiling
   independent of caller configuration. Cap violations are `ResourceBound`,
   not partial parses.
8. **Canonical syntax, not canonical CAD**: Part-21 output has fixed
   whitespace/keyword casing and numeric-ID instance order. It never
   reorders parameters or complex components, whose schema meaning is
   unknown at this layer. Numeric lexical spelling remains identity-bearing:
   this is layout canonicalization, not schema-aware numeric normalization.

## Error model

`IoError`: `Malformed { at, what }`, `Unsupported`, `ResourceBound`,
`Schema { row, column, what }`. `PromotionRefusal` carries blocking
defects + fixes + the refused receipt. The STEP syntax kernel uses
`Malformed` for grammar/graph failures, `Unsupported` for staged encoded
characters and binary literals, and `ResourceBound` for every declared
limit.

## Determinism class

**D0**: fixed parse/emit orders, BTreeMap welds, no ambient state.

## Cancellation behavior

Legacy mesh/catalog parsers are single-pass and element-capped. The STEP
kernel is deliberately multi-pass (parse, shape/graph validation,
canonical-layout serialization) and cap-bounded, but it has no `Cx` and
makes no cancellation-latency claim. Cancellation-aware streaming belongs
to the later geometry/tessellation lane.

## Unsafe boundary

Zero `unsafe`.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs` (JSON verdicts, suite `fs-io/conformance`):
io-001 STL/OBJ/PLY round trips (exact where the format allows) +
deterministic bytes + ASCII STL fixture; io-002 the defect zoo
(duplicate/degenerate/hole/unreferenced) censused, repaired, promoted
with receipts — and an over-budget hole REFUSED with actionable fixes
and a refused receipt; io-003 13.5k mutants + truncations + junk with
zero panics; io-004 PLY face-list integer validation; io-005 AISC-flavored
CSV + JSON catalogs, quoting, and the teaching-error battery; io-006 3MF ZIP
structure (EOCD, entry count, model XML), GLB chunk accounting, VTK section
counts.

`tests/step.rs` (G0/G3): forward-reference and complex-entity parsing,
canonical permutation-invariant DATA ordering, doubled-apostrophe string
round trip, AP-family hint/receipt binding, duplicate and dangling
reference refusal, malformed/truncated envelope/comment/string/value
refusal, mandatory-header shape checks, strict uppercase keywords, exact
typed-parameter arity, explicit resource/hard-depth-cap refusal, and
writer-side revalidation of caller-constructed invalid graphs.

## PLY element order (bead wqd.25.1)

Element order is the header's to define: faces may legally precede
vertices. Parsing collects triangulated faces as pending records
(structural checks and the 1024-item list cap and triangle cap apply
immediately); index RANGE validation runs once, after every element is
consumed, against the final vertex count — with the exact offending
triangle ordinal in the diagnostic. Vertex-first and face-first files
import identically in both ASCII and binary (conformance-tested).

## No-claim boundaries

- **STEP CAD semantics remain STAGED**: the shipping subset is a
  syntax/instance-graph kernel only. It does not load an EXPRESS schema,
  authorize AP203/AP214 conformance, interpret products/assemblies/units,
  tessellate surfaces, produce a `Soup` or SDF chart, localize geometric
  defects, fit NURBS, write a topological B-rep/solid, or certify a
  deviation bound. `StepProfileHint` is label recognition only.
- **Part-21 encoded characters and binary literals are refused** in this
  first subset. Source bytes must be ASCII; encoded-character directives
  and binary payloads need their own bounded conformance fixtures before
  admission.
- **Keywords/enumerations are strict uppercase Part-21 tokens**. Schema
  declaration admission may compare ASCII case-insensitively only because
  it operates on string payloads, not grammar keywords.
- **IGES and IFC are STAGED, not promised**; their quarantine paths have
  not shipped.
- **OBJ vt/vn and materials are dropped** (documented lossy subset);
  PLY color/normal properties are skipped, not preserved.
- **PLY binary_big_endian is refused** (structured `Unsupported`).
- **3MF/GLB are WRITE-ONLY** (import of container formats is follow-up);
  the 3MF is the minimal core-spec package, no extensions.
- **VTK export is legacy-ASCII**, one optional scalar field; XML VTK and
  vector/tensor fields land with fs-viz interop needs.
- **The census's manifoldness check is combinatorial** (edge counts +
  half-edge build); geometric self-intersection certification belongs to
  the validity-certificates machinery (wqd.23) and can be layered onto
  promotion by callers.
- **Receipts hash with FNV-1a**; HELM upgrades to the BLAKE3-class
  content address when writing the `imports` row (same field, stated in
  the receipt schema).

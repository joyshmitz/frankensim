# CONTRACT: fs-eproc

## Purpose and layer
Anytime-valid inference (plan §9.6, Bet 5): betting e-processes, mixture
confidence sequences, e-value arithmetic, e-BH — the statistical layer that
makes optional stopping VALID. Layer: L4.

## Public types and semantics
- `BettingEProcess::new(null_mean)` — one-sided test of H₀: mean ≤ m for
  outcomes in [0,1] (WSR betting lineage): log-wealth via strict fs-math ln;
  PREDICTABLE plug-in bet (regularized empirical mean/var, clipped one-sided
  to `aggressiveness / max(m, 1−m)`); `observe`, `e_value`, `log_e_value`,
  `rejects_at(alpha)` (Ville threshold 1/α).
- `LossSpan::new(span)` — checked finite-positive, fixed-before-observation
  support for `abs(loss_b - loss_a)`. The span is part of the statistical
  claim and replay identity; it must not be estimated from the race data.
- `PairwiseRace::new(loss_span)` — the e-racing primitive for
  lower-is-better losses. Construction requires the scale explicitly; there
  is no default unit span. It maps
  `d = ((loss_b - loss_a) / span + 1) / 2` without clipping and feeds a
  betting process at null 1/2; `a_beats_b(alpha)` reports evidence that A has
  lower conditional mean loss than B. The required null is
  `E[loss_b,t - loss_a,t | F_(t-1)] <= 0`, not marginal-mean equality alone.
- `GaussianMixtureCs::new(sigma, rho, alpha)` — Robbins normal-mixture CS
  for sub-Gaussian means: time-uniform interval with closed-form radius
  √((tσ²+ρ)(ln((tσ²+ρ)/ρ) + 2ln(1/α)))/t; also `e_value_for(m)` (the
  mixture martingale as a two-sided e-value).
- Arithmetic: `combine_product` (independent), `combine_average` (valid
  under ARBITRARY dependence; extended-real-safe max-shifted log-sum-exp),
  `e_to_p` (Markov). NaN and indeterminate zero-times-infinity products are
  refused before they can become evidence.
- `e_benjamini_hochberg(log_e, alpha)` — Wang–Ramdas e-BH: reject k̂ largest
  where e_(k) ≥ m/(αk); FDR ≤ α under arbitrary dependence; deterministic
  tie-breaking (descending e, ascending index).

- `hardening` module (patch Rev M, bead 7tv.9; [F], behind
  `conformal-hardening`): the anytime-valid layer's assumptions as
  operational contracts. `MondrianConformal` (per-bucket split
  conformal at the ⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉ rule; buckets below the calibration
  floor REFUSE with a teaching count instead of extrapolating;
  `marginal_band` kept for the comparison), `DriftMonitor` (sequential
  two-sample PIT betting pair, combined as one equal-weight mixture e-process
  so the two-sided decision spends alpha once, against the COMPOSITE null
  mean ∈ 1/2 ± δ, δ = max(1/√n_train, 0.02) — the finite-calibration
  tolerance, added after an unslacked monitor false-fired on the
  training sample's own noise; detection shrinks `validity_scale`),
  `CoverageClaim`/`fcr_flag` (per-claim miscoverage e-processes,
  e-BH over them spends the explicit false-coverage budget),
  `admission_alpha` (the Bonferroni reservation for study admission),
  `ExchangeabilityCard` (assumptions declared, ledger-ready).

## Invariants
- Validity is STRUCTURAL: any predictable bet in the admissible range yields
  a supermartingale under H₀ — strategy affects power only.
- Boundedness contract enforced: observations outside [0,1] are REFUSED
  (feeding unbounded data would silently void the guarantee).
- Confidence-sequence observations, nulls, calibration residuals, and drift
  samples are finite; malformed alpha/budget values are refused. A rejected
  observation cannot mutate running state.
- Pairwise support is enforced before wealth changes: non-finite losses,
  subtraction overflow, and differences outside the declared `LossSpan`
  return `PairwiseInputError`. Clipping is forbidden because it changes the
  estimand and can create betting drift under an equal-raw-mean null.
- Trajectories are bit-replayable: strict fs-math functions + caller-supplied
  fs-rand streams (tested: identical tournament decision, time, and bits).
- log-space wealth: no overflow at extreme evidence.

## Error model
Malformed scalar process parameters (null mean outside (0,1), out-of-range
bounded-process outcomes, non-finite confidence-sequence observations,
non-finite/non-positive sigma/rho, alpha outside (0,1), malformed calibration
data) panic with teaching messages. Pairwise loss data and span violations are fallible
`PairwiseInputError` values and leave pairwise wealth unchanged, because a
production race must be able to surface a no-claim result rather than panic.

## Determinism class
Deterministic CROSS-ISA (strict fs-math + pure arithmetic).

## Cancellation behavior
O(1) per observation; the CALLER owns kill-handles (fs-exec) — this crate
supplies the decision signal e-racing acts on.

## Unsafe boundary
None.

## Feature flags
`conformal-hardening` enables the [F] Mondrian conformal, drift-monitor, and
false-coverage-budget machinery. It is default-off.

## Conformance tests (empirical, seeded, release-mode)
Ville validity under ADVERSARIAL stopping (4000 sims × 2000 horizon:
type-I 0.0305 ≤ 0.05); power scaling (median stop 241 @ δ=.05, 32 @ δ=.15);
time-uniform CS coverage (miss 0.0487 ≤ 0.05; radius 0.573→0.086);
e-BH FDR 0.001 ≤ 0.1 at power 1.00 (10 signals / 30 nulls × 300 sims);
race decided + bit-replayable; arithmetic laws; bounded-input refusal;
declared-span boundaries and one-ULP refusal; equal-mean skew counterexample.

The five empirical Gauntlet aggregates use canonical fs-obs
`ConformanceCase` rows under `fs-eproc`, with distinct `ville-validity`,
`power`, `cs-coverage`, `e-bh`, and `race-replay` scopes. Every row records the
actual shared fs-rand input root `0xB7E1` (`0xE90C ^ 0x5EED`) in its `seed`
field. Kernel 1 and the logical input tiles are: 0..3999 for Ville validity;
1000..1199 and 2000..2199 for power; 50000..51499 plus shrinkage tile 99999
for CS coverage; `200000 + sim*64 + hypothesis` for e-BH; and tile 777 twice
for race replay. These are logical RNG coordinates, never worker, thread, Cx,
or scheduler seeds. Each fresh emitter produces one sequence-zero event and
runs the failure-record lint plus fs-obs wire validation. The rows remain after
their existing statistical and replay assertions, so a failed gate aborts
before emission as an ordinary Rust diagnostic rather than a structured
failure record.

`tests/hardening.rs`, behind `conformal-hardening`, emits canonical aggregate
`ConformanceCase` verdicts for ch-001..ch-005 and validated object-shaped
`Custom` measurement companions for ch-001..ch-004. The literal input roots
are `0xa11ce`, `0xd21f7`, `0xfc12`, `0x0b71`, and `0x5eed`, respectively;
the suite has no execution/Cx seed. Assertions and expectations reached before
an aggregate verdict remain ordinary Rust test diagnostics. The fixed
regressions ch-006..ch-008 remain assertion-only and do not claim aggregate
event coverage. Central proof must explicitly enable
`fs-eproc/conformal-hardening`; a default-feature pass skips the target.

`tests/adversarial_rotation.rs` is the fixed seeded e-process
certifier-of-certifier tranche in `frankensim-epic-ascent-7tv.21.9`, advancing
the e-process scope of `frankensim-epic-gauntlet-6nb.7`. Four
strategies choose predictably among four dyadic bounded null laws whose
conditional means are exactly one half, then stop at the Ville threshold,
their declared history-dependent rule, or a 1024-observation horizon. Each
strategy uses 1024 disjoint fs-rand logical streams and must record at most 80
level-0.05 crossings (a greater-than-four-binomial-standard-deviation finite
gate), exact law/stop/observation accounting, and a non-colliding tile range.
One canonical configuration identity binds the laws, strategies, stopping
rules and numeric selector thresholds, alpha, seed, Philox kernel/tile/index
layout, draw method/count, stream-semantics version, and crate versions; a
result identity and object-shaped `fs-obs` receipt retain all four empirical
outcomes before five linted, wire-validated
`ConformanceCase` verdicts are emitted.

`tests/ebh_dependence.rs` is the G0 e-BH certifier-of-certifier tranche in
`frankensim-epic-ascent-7tv.21.10`. It exhaustively enumerates three exact
finite laws over 4,096 simultaneous hypotheses. In the global-null law, 64
perfectly dependent blocks of 64 hypotheses are mutually exclusive across
1,024 equiprobable phases; an active block has e-value 1,024, so every null's
mean e-value is exactly one and FWER = FDR = 64/1024 = 1/16. In the mixed
perfect-dependence law, 4,076 true nulls share one e=17 shock among 17 phases
beside 20 fixed alternatives, giving exact FDR
`4076 / (4096 * 17) <= 1/16`. A third exact law gives each of 63 mutually
exclusive 64-null blocks e=63 once beside 64 alternatives: production e-BH
rejects no nulls, while a test-local seeded-broken comparator that omits the
family-size factor from `m/(alpha*k)` rejects the active block and incurs FDP
1/2 in every phase. The latter implementation is mutation-test code only and
is never used by production paths.

One fs-rand seed chooses a one-draw cyclic rotation of original hypothesis
IDs; all probability phases are then enumerated rather than sampled. A
canonical configuration identity binds the laws, phase order, evidence and
threshold values, family/block geometry, alpha, rotation coordinates and
algorithm, stream-semantics version, comparator mutation, and crate versions.
The result identity and object-shaped `fs-obs` receipt retain exact rejection,
false-rejection, marginal-validity, and first-shape-failure fields before four
linted, wire-validated `ConformanceCase` verdicts are emitted.

## No-claim boundaries
- Empirical-Bernstein/hedged closed-form CS for bounded means (mixture CS
  covers sub-Gaussian; EB variant is follow-up scope with its consumers).
- Conformal e-prediction (fs-surrogate + conformal-hardening beads).
- Both-ISA nightly rotation over a refreshed null/adversary corpus remains
  certify-certifiers follow-up scope. The landed rotation battery is one fixed
  finite seeded pseudorandom campaign: it can catch implementation drift but
  is not an exhaustive proof over null laws, stopping times, dependence
  structures, seeds, horizons, or ISAs. No cross-ISA execution evidence is
  produced by this code-first slice.
- The e-BH dependence battery exhausts its three declared finite laws, not all
  possible dependence structures or alternative configurations. It is an
  executable cross-examination of the production step-up rule and one seeded
  mutation, not a replacement for the arbitrary-dependence theorem. It makes
  no nightly-refresh, cross-ISA, scheduler/Cx, wall-clock, or throughput claim;
  central Cargo/RCH/DSR proof is pending for the code-first landing.
- Two-sided betting tests; asymptotic variants; sub-exponential extensions.
- A caller-supplied finite span is a checked assumption, not a certificate that
  the underlying stochastic process has that support. Runtime breach refuses
  the observation; justifying the bound remains the caller's obligation.
- The canonical Gauntlet rows retain evidence for the fixed seeded empirical
  schedules above; they do not turn those observed rates or stopping times into
  an exhaustive finite-sample proof for untested data-generating processes.

## No-claim boundaries (hardening)

- The drift monitor tests the CANDIDATE SCORE distribution (1-D PIT);
  multivariate covariate drift needs a score projection chosen by the
  caller — the projection's blind spots are the caller's declaration.
- The composite-null slack δ trades sensitivity below δ for
  no-false-alarm robustness: shifts smaller than the calibration
  noise floor are undetectable BY DESIGN.
- FCR flagging inherits e-BH's guarantee under arbitrary dependence;
  the admission bound is Bonferroni (conservative on purpose).
- Weighted-conformal handling of optimization-induced shift (beyond
  detect-and-refuse/recalibrate) is the growth path the bead names.

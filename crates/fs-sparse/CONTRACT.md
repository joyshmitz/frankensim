# CONTRACT: fs-sparse

## Purpose and layer
Sparse matrix formats (CSR, BSR, SELL-C-σ), deterministic COO assembly,
SpMV/SpMM kernels, and pattern algebra (transpose, symmetrize, Gustavson
SpGEMM — the building block of AMG's Galerkin triple product). Layer:
**L1 BEDROCK**. The default numeric core uses only `std`; the off-by-default
`fnx-interop` and `fnp-interop` features add the documented FrankenNetworkx and
FrankenNumpy path dependencies. Plan §6.2.

v1 includes the scalar correctness core plus compact-index CSR, deterministic
sharded CSR/SELL SpMV, tiled parallel COO assembly, blocked SpMM, sparse-SPA
SpGEMM, and a runtime-dispatched x86 AVX2+FMA code-generation capsule. The
ignored release-only roofline harness reports attainment against measured
STREAM and enforces its 85% gate only when `FS_SPARSE_ROOFLINE_GATE=1`;
results are machine-specific, not a universal throughput guarantee.

## Public types and semantics
- `Coo` — triplet staging; duplicates ACCUMULATE (FEM element-assembly
  contract). `assemble()` produces canonical CSR.
- `Csr` — the canonical format. INVARIANT: within each row, columns are
  strictly ascending, no duplicates. Every constructor establishes this
  (`from_parts` validates and panics otherwise); every algorithm may rely on
  it. `try_from_parts_with_checkpoint` validates the same invariant without a
  panic and invokes a caller callback once per row and stored column, allowing
  cancellation-aware callers without adding an executor dependency. `row(r)`
  doubles as the graph neighbor view (CSR IS the adjacency structure). `spmv`,
  `spmm` (dense row-major right-hand sides), `to_dense` (oracle use),
  `identity`, `get`.
- `Bsr` — block CSR with fixed r×c blocks for FEM vector unknowns.
  `from_csr` requires divisible dimensions (padding is a modeling decision,
  never invented by a conversion). `to_csr` drops exact-zero fill.
- `Sell` — SELL-C-σ, stable-sorted by descending row length within σ-row
  windows, lane-fastest layout. Stores TRUE per-row lengths; pad slots exist
  physically but are never read. `to_csr` is bitwise lossless.
- `ops::{transpose, symmetrize, spgemm, spgemm_sparse_spa}` — pattern
  algebra on canonical CSR. `spgemm` is the dense-SPA reference path;
  `spgemm_sparse_spa` uses a per-row BTree accumulator for very wide products
  without O(ncols) scratch, while preserving the reference accumulation order
  and ascending-column output.
- `interop::{csr_to_graph_snapshot, graph_snapshot_to_csr, WEIGHT_KEY,
  InteropError}` (feature `fnx-interop`, bead gtql) — FrankenNetworkx bridge.
  `Csr → GraphSnapshot`: square adjacency only (else `NotSquare`); node `i` ⇄
  key `"i"`, stored `(r, c, v)` ⇄ directed `EdgeSnapshot` `r→c` with weight `v`
  under `WEIGHT_KEY`, emitted in canonical row-major/ascending-column order.
  `GraphSnapshot → Csr`: nodes map to indices BY ORDER (keys may be arbitrary
  strings), weights read from `WEIGHT_KEY` (`Float`/`Int` coerced, else `1.0`),
  parallel `(r, c)` edges SUM (multigraph → simple). Necessarily COPIES (fnx's
  `Graph` is string-keyed and owned — no zero-copy path; the honest deviation
  from "wrap, do not copy"). Round-trip `Csr → snapshot → Csr` is the identity,
  bitwise on values.
- `precond::{Precond, IdentityPrecond, Chebyshev, Ilu0/ilu0/IluBreakdown,
  SaAmg, pcg/PcgReport, lambda_max_estimate}` — the solver-stack toolkit.
  `Precond::apply(r, z)` is the operator interface. Chebyshev: degree-k
  three-term recurrence on the band [λmax/α, λmax], λmax by deterministic
  power iteration (fixed libm-free start, 1.1 safety — enclosure tested
  vs analytic spectra). ILU(0): zero-fill on the CSR pattern, sequential
  v1, typed `IluBreakdown{row}` (shift-retry is caller policy). SaAmg:
  symmetric strength graph, GREEDY INDEX-ORDER aggregation with
  lowest-index tie-breaks (P2 on setup), Jacobi-smoothed prolongator
  (ω = 4/3·λmax(D⁻¹A)), Galerkin triple product via in-crate SpGEMM,
  V-cycle with Chebyshev smoothing and ILU-PCG coarsest solve;
  `operator_complexity()` and `level_sizes` are the memory-honesty
  evidence. `pcg` is a REFERENCE driver (solver stack supersedes it).

## Invariants
1. **Cross-format bitwise SpMV equality**: CSR, BSR, and SELL SpMV produce
   BIT-IDENTICAL outputs. Mechanism: every kernel accumulates each row in
   ascending-global-column order with fused `mul_add` from a +0.0 start; BSR
   fill zeros are provably inert (a fused `0·x + acc` is exactly `acc`, and
   `acc` cannot become −0.0 from a +0.0 start under round-to-nearest); SELL
   never reads pads. Tested on FEM, random, and skewed fixtures.
2. **Assembly canonicalization**: `Coo::assemble` output is a pure function
   of the triplet multiset ordered by (row, col, insertion sequence) —
   stream/tile interleavings that preserve each (row, col)'s own contribution
   order produce bitwise-identical matrices (tested with shuffled streams).
   Contribution order within one (row, col) pair is LOGICAL identity (e.g.
   element id); callers parallelizing assembly must preserve it.
3. `spmm` output equals column-by-column `spmv` bitwise (tested).
4. `transpose` is a bitwise involution: `(Aᵀ)ᵀ = A` exactly; values are
   moved, never recomputed.
5. `symmetrize` output is bitwise symmetric (`Sᵀ = S` exactly; IEEE
   `midpoint` commutes) and fixes symmetric inputs.
6. `spgemm(A, I) = A` and `spgemm(I, A) = A` bitwise; contributions to each
   C[i][j] accumulate in ascending-k order (deterministic).
7. `spgemm_sparse_spa(A, B) = spgemm(A, B)` bitwise on tested random and
   very-wide products; it changes accumulator storage only, not numerical
   order or output canonicalization.
8. Preconditioner setup and solves are rerun-deterministic BITWISE
   (hierarchy shapes, iteration counts, and solutions — tested), and the
   spectral-bound estimate ENCLOSES the true λmax on tested fixtures
   (over-estimation safe by construction, safety factor 1.1).
9. AMG on 2D Poisson: near-grid-independent PCG iterations (32² vs 64²
   within a tested band), operator complexity < 2, and the anisotropic
   ε = 1e-3 fixture converges (tested).

## Error model
Structural violations panic with structured messages: out-of-range COO
indices, non-canonical `from_parts` input, dimension mismatches in
spmv/spmm/spgemm/symmetrize, indivisible BSR block shapes. These are
programmer errors; silently proceeding would void determinism claims. No
allocation-failure handling beyond std's. The checkpointed CSR constructor
instead returns `Ok(None)` for malformed canonical parts and passes through a
caller checkpoint error as `Err`.

## Determinism class
**Bit-deterministic cross-ISA by construction**: kernels are fixed-order
+, ×, mul_add with no libm or data-dependent reassociation; parallel assembly
and sharded kernels preserve their serial twins' logical accumulation order.
Evidence: the conformance battery (three-matrix zoo × three formats ×
transpose/symmetrize/SpGEMM) folds all output bits into FNV-64 golden hash
`0xbcf5_52b6_c5bf_aed6`; the preconditioner battery (Chebyshev apply +
ILU-PCG + AMG-PCG solutions + hierarchy shapes) hashes to
`0x752f_215a_26e3_2fea`. Both recorded on aarch64-apple (M4 Pro) and
verified identical on x86-64 (Threadripper). Golden-evidence policy
applies. NO platform libm feeds any solver state (workspace contract
rule).

## Cancellation behavior
The serial and `std`-threaded numeric kernels do not accept an asupersync `Cx`
and are uninterruptible once called. Scoped parallel lanes join/drain their
workers before returning. After top-level shape checks,
`Csr::try_from_parts_with_checkpoint` invokes a caller checkpoint once per row
and once per visited stored column. No bounded-latency cancellation claim is
made for SpMV, SpMM, SpGEMM, parallel assembly, or preconditioners.

## Unsafe boundary
One registered capsule exists at `src/fma/mod.rs`, with its calling invariants
recorded in `src/fma/SAFETY.md` and `unsafe-capsules.json`. On x86-64, safe
dispatchers verify AVX2+FMA support before calling private `#[target_feature]`
functions; the unsafe scope is the target-feature calling contract, while the
kernel bodies remain safe slice arithmetic. Workspace-level `unsafe_code =
"deny"` remains in force outside that module-local capsule.

## Feature flags
- `fnx-interop` (default OFF) — pulls the optional `fnx-classes` + `fnx-runtime`
  path deps and enables the `interop` module (Csr ⇄ FrankenNetworkx
  `GraphSnapshot`). Off by default so the L1 crate stays dependency-lean; the
  numeric core never pulls a constellation crate.
- `fnp-interop` (default OFF) — pulls the optional `fnp-ufunc` + `fnp-dtype`
  path deps and enables the `interop_fnp` module (Csr ⇄ FrankenNumpy
  `UFuncArray`). Same dependency-lean rationale.

## Conformance tests
`tests/conformance.rs`: cross-format bitwise battery + golden hash. In-crate
suites: assembly canonicalization + stream-order invariance, SpMV vs dense
oracle, linearity, adversarial patterns (empty rows, dense row, single
column, empty matrix), BSR/SELL round-trips, SELL padding economics,
checkpointed CSR publication and malformed canonical-part refusal,
transpose involution, symmetrize bitwise symmetry, SpGEMM vs dense oracle +
Laplacian-square pattern sanity, sparse-SPA SpGEMM vs dense-SPA reference on
random and 2e6-column-wide products, structured rejections. Any
reimplementation must pass the conformance battery bit-for-bit.
Bead 4nh8 adds 600 shrink-armed generated 8×8 cases (seed `0x5A_5001`): up
to 64 integer COO triplets, including duplicates and stored zeros, are applied
to an integer vector through CSR, BSR 4×4, and SELL-C-σ `(8, 32)` and compared
bitwise. The fixed cross-ISA golden `0xbcf5_52b6_c5bf_aed6` is unchanged.

Bead 6ys.18.7 adds the cheap structured PR subset through `fs-casebook`: an
exact out-of-order COO assembly KAT with duplicate chains, exact CSR/BSR/SELL
SpMV agreement against an independent literal result, checkpointed canonical
publication plus typed and malformed-input refusals, pinned input digests, and
a disclosed one-bit seeded corruption proving structured failure reporting and
merge-gate refusal. It preserves the aggregate golden and the broader
property, WSBF, preconditioner, release-performance, and cross-ISA lanes as
separate evidence; this subset awards no fresh oracle, performance, nightly,
or dual-ISA claim.

`tests/preconditioner_casebook.rs` adds a structured portable subset for the
preconditioner surface. Canonical frames retain complete CSR storage, right-hand
sides, known solutions, initial output/iterate bits, Chebyshev and AMG setup
options, PCG tolerances and caps, refusal policies, crate/record versions, and
every numerical ceiling. Receipts bind direct-apply and solve bits,
`PcgReport` fields, the Chebyshev band, AMG hierarchy sizes and operator
complexity, independently recomputed residuals, solution deltas and framed
ceilings, and typed or panic refusal observations, and must replay exactly
within one executing build.
The green subset covers one exact dyadic ILU(0) KAT, bounded Chebyshev and
genuine multilevel SA-AMG fixtures, and explicit ILU/Chebyshev admission
failures. A disclosed seeded exact-solution reference mutation must reproduce
one stable red record that `assert_green` refuses. This does not replace or
re-award the retained cross-ISA preconditioner golden. It makes no claim for
large-grid or grid-independent behavior, arbitrary SPD matrices, performance,
cancellation, an independent external oracle, or fresh dual-ISA/full-G5
execution.

`tests/frankenscipy_oracle_casebook.rs` supplies the missing test-only
FrankenScipy sparse baseline. Identical canonical CSR storage is admitted by
`fs-sparse::Csr` and `fsci_sparse::CsrMatrix`; a 4×5 dyadic KAT pins both
outputs bit-for-bit, including an empty-row positive zero. Twelve disclosed
LCG fixtures (root `0x5A25_5A25_D15C_0001`, 84 output rows) compare the fused
FrankenSim path with FrankenScipy's separately rounded matvec under the
declared absolute oracle-agreement bound `32·f64::EPSILON`. Canonical
little-endian frames retain every row pointer, column, value, vector,
implementation/API version, tolerance, and expected KAT bits. The input
frame is sufficient to regenerate both outputs; the passing structured record
retains separate FNV digests of all 84 computed output-bit rows, while any
failing row logs both implementations' exact bits and the full frame. The
input digests are `d7c1b8ae30777f71` (KAT), `735ea2d324e967bc` (seeded), and
`3d1185b7e82a131f` (shape-refusal policy). Seed `0x5A25_0000` flips one
reference bit, producing one replay-identical red record at digest
`323f3591ddcb0d6e` and an `assert_green` refusal. The structural case records
fs-sparse's documented actionable programmer-error panic and FrankenScipy's
typed `IncompatibleShape` refusal, with the fs-sparse output unchanged.
`fsci-sparse` remains a development dependency only; this tranche is central
package-proof pending.

## FrankenNumpy interop (bead gtql item c, feature `fnp-interop`)

Scout verdict recorded: fnp-ndarray holds only layout metadata; the
owned array type is `fnp_ufunc::UFuncArray` (owned `Vec<f64>` +
shape), so these are CONVERSIONS by necessity — no zero-copy view
exists into another crate's owned storage; the borrowed views remain
`Csr::row`/`Csr::to_dense` on this side. `csr_to_dense_array`
densifies (O(nrows·ncols), overflow-refused) with unstored entries as
+0.0 — explicit stored zeros are documented lossiness (round trip is
the identity exactly for CSRs without them). `dense_array_to_csr`
accepts rank-2 only, reads the f64 value plane, drops ±0.0, and
REFUSES non-finite entries with their position (fail closed). Off by
default; the L1 core pulls no constellation crate unless opted in.

## No-claim boundaries
- **Performance scope**: `tests/roofline.rs` reports machine-specific STREAM
  attainment and asserts the ≥85% all-core gate only under
  `FS_SPARSE_ROOFLINE_GATE=1`; no every-host throughput guarantee is made.
  Software-prefetch/autotuner integration and fs-tilelang-generated bodies are
  not present. The shipped x86 acceleration is runtime AVX2+FMA codegen for the
  existing fixed-order bodies.
- BSR `to_csr` is only structurally lossless for matrices without stored
  exact-zero values (fill is dropped by value test); the dense expansion is
  always bitwise faithful.
- `spgemm_sparse_spa` is a deterministic scalar BTree-accumulator path, not a
  tuned hash-SPA throughput path; wide-matrix memory shape is improved, but no
  speedup claim is made.
- ILU(0) is sequential (level scheduling recorded); IC(0)-specific
  symmetric storage is unclaimed (ILU covers SPD use). Supernodal
  Cholesky deferred per its own scope cap. AMG coarsest solve is
  ILU-PCG (dense direct coarse solve joins solver-stack integration).
  No 1e8-DOF scaling claims yet (release-mode scaling lane).
- **Interop scope**: `fnx-interop` copies between square CSR adjacency and the
  owned `GraphSnapshot`; `fnp-interop` converts between CSR and the owned dense
  `UFuncArray`, requiring O(nrows·ncols) memory when densifying and losing the
  distinction between explicit and unstored ±0.0. `Csr::row` remains the
  borrowed sparse neighbor/value view; no zero-copy FrankenNetworkx or
  FrankenNumpy view type is claimed.
- Canonical `Csr`, `Bsr`, and `Sell` use `usize` indices. `CsrCompact` narrows
  column indices to `u32` and refuses dimensions outside that space; compact
  BSR/SELL indices are not claimed.
- The FrankenScipy Casebook proves agreement for its fixed canonical KAT and
  disclosed seeded finite fixture family. It does not establish Python SciPy
  execution, arbitrary-matrix equivalence, performance parity, fresh
  dual-ISA execution, or the umbrella's full G5 sweep. The `32·EPSILON`
  margin is an absolute oracle-agreement bound for the fixture's five terms per row and
  `|a_ij|, |x_j| ≤ 1/2`; it is not a dimension-free tolerance for callers.

//! fs-wedge — go-to-market wedge selection as data (plan addendum,
//! Proposal 7). Layer: UTIL (pure data + audit; no dependencies).
//!
//! The wedge is the beachhead. The load-bearing DOCTRINE is a NEGATIVE one:
//!
//! > DO NOT SELL AGAINST PEAK SINGLE-PHYSICS FIDELITY ANYWHERE.
//!
//! Unification at the solver level loses to specialized codes on every
//! individual physics; nobody buys a beautifully glued assembly of second-rate
//! solvers, and nobody needs FrankenSim where one mature code owns the whole
//! problem. The wedge must be a WORKFLOW that is today three tools, lossy
//! handoffs, and week-long iteration — where certified seams (the sheaf),
//! incremental re-solve of variants (Proposal 2), and autonomous gradient
//! exploration (Proposal 1) dominate EVEN WITH merely-decent kernels.
//!
//! This crate preserves the plan's original ranking for replay, but those
//! judgment-only scores are [`ScoreUse::SupersededForDecisionUse`]. Current
//! decisions use [`MeasuredWedgeInputs`]: source-inventory readiness,
//! validation-data access, CAD burden, and static compute envelopes, each with
//! a method and evidence pointer. An explicit nine-factor comparison then ranks
//! full CHT, SDF structural/topology assurance, and a narrower thermal-design-
//! assurance candidate. Ratings remain separate from evidence authority, and
//! both rating and weight flip sensitivities are recorded. The
//! [`CycleTimeBaseline`] remains a separately identified placeholder until a
//! customer measurement replaces it.

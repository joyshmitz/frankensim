//! fs-truss — ground-structure truss layout optimization (plan §9.5
//! [S/F], bead 7tv.13): candidate members at scale → plastic-design
//! LP layout with explicit convergence diagnostics → Euler/code-based
//! sizing with catalog snapping → fs-solid rod re-analysis. The
//! steel-and-concrete flagship's engine (§15.2).
//!
//! Layer: L4 (ASCENT).
//! - [`ground`]: node grids + candidate members under fabrication
//!   rules (length bounds, angle sets, neighbor caps), built on
//!   FrankenNetworkx graphs; generation reproducible and ledgered.
//! - [`lp`]: the member-force (plastic design) LP — minimize volume
//!   subject to nodal equilibrium and yield, tension/compression
//!   split — solved by an in-house PDHG (Chambolle–Pock) first-order
//!   primal-dual iteration: sparse-matvec-dominated, deterministic,
//!   warm-startable, with primal/dual objective-separation and KKT residual
//!   tracking (diagnostics, not a finite optimum certificate; the vetted
//!   Michell closed-form catalogue
//!   comparison is a ledgered row pending the fs-fab oracle spec's
//!   constants — stated, never silently skipped).
//! - [`sizing`]: continuous areas from yield, EULER buckling floors
//!   for compression members, joint parsimony with MANDATORY
//!   equilibrium re-verification after pruning, catalog UP-snapping
//!   (feasibility preserved by construction) and the member-by-member
//!   code-check audit table (fs-constraint `Code` rows).
//! - [`rodcheck`]: the critical compression member re-analyzed as an
//!   fs-solid Cosserat rod with a seeded imperfection to 1.3× design
//!   load — the tfz.14/tfz.15 global-buckling spot check.

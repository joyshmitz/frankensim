# fs-truss CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: L4 (ASCENT). Ground-structure truss layout optimization (plan
§9.5 [S/F], bead 7tv.13): candidate members under fabrication rules →
plastic-design LP solved by an in-house first-order primal-dual
iteration with explicit convergence diagnostics → Euler/code sizing
with catalog snapping → fs-solid rod re-analysis. The
steel-and-concrete flagship's engine (§15.2).

## Public types and semantics

- `GroundRules` is immutable and admitted only through `try_new` or a finite
  default. `GroundLimits` applies caller limits beneath crate hard ceilings.
  `GroundStructure::try_grid` and `try_from_parts` return immutable nodes,
  canonical members, length-consistent vectors, and FrankenNetworkx graph state
  only after complete validation, bounded pair/triplet/member/retained-byte work,
  fallible vector reservations, and a final cancellation checkpoint. Imported
  within-tolerance lengths are replaced with recomputed canonical `hypot` bits;
  graph compatibility timestamps are cleared before publication.
  Generation is reproducible and `stats()` is the ledger row (counts + FNV
  hash).
- `LayoutCase` immutably admits exact-shape support flags and finite nodal
  loads. `LayoutLimits` bounds free DOFs, split variables, staged sparse
  triplets, and retained LP storage beneath hard ceilings.
- `LayoutLp::try_assemble`: the member-force LP — split tension/compression
  variables `q⁺, q⁻ ≥ 0`, volume objective `Σ l(q⁺+q⁻)/σ_y`, nodal
  equilibrium on free DOFs. Assembly validates canonical ground identity,
  surviving connected load DOFs, exact sparse dimensions/nnz, finite positive
  load norm at least `1e-30` with finite squared norm, costs and norm state,
  and cancellation before publishing immutable LP state. Sparse A/A-transpose
  construction uses fallibly reserved canonical CSR buffers directly and polls
  throughout counting, fill, validation, transpose, and norm multiplies.
  `solve` = PDHG (Chambolle–Pock) with
  power-iteration step sizing, sparse matvecs, warm starts across load
  cases, deterministic iterations. `solve` is fallible, caps direct solves at
  one million iterations, and validates controls plus warm-start shape/domain
  before work. `diagnostics` returns
  (relative primal/dual objective separation, equilibrium residual, volume):
  under this saddle the nominal dual objective is `−bᵀy` with feasibility
  `c + Aᵀy ≥ 0`, approximately restored by a floating uniform shrink of y —
  the battery pinned the OPPOSITE textbook
  convention (`+bᵀy`, `Aᵀy ≤ c`) reporting gap = 2 on exactly-solved
  instances.
- `LayoutLp::certify_optimum` is the separate cold certificate path. It turns
  split iterates into signed member forces, selects a deterministic square
  member basis after dropping only identically-zero/zero-load rows, and proves
  basis invertibility plus an exact equilibrium correction by the outward
  Neumann condition `rho = ||I - H M||_inf < 1`. The retained member-force box
  contains one correlated exactly equilibrated force; its positive/negative
  split is therefore nonnegative by construction. Independent residual boxes
  are sanity checks only: zero containment by itself is not the existence
  proof. The primal upper endpoint is the outward sum of cost times the
  supremum absolute repaired force.
- The dual witness uses this crate's `c + A^T y >= 0`, `-b^T y` convention.
  A representable uniform shrink is re-evaluated directly from authoritative
  `A` with `fs-ivl`; every outward slack lower endpoint must be nonnegative.
  The finite lower endpoint is combined with the primal endpoint only when
  they are ordered. `LayoutOptimalityCertificate` fields are private and bind
  `A`, `b`, `c`, both input iterates, solver settings, proof budgets, correction
  and arithmetic versions, all witness endpoints, and the final receipt with
  domain-separated `fs-blake3` identities. `verify_optimum_certificate`
  recomputes the proof. `certify_optimum_for_report` additionally requires the
  private identity of the exact `solve` output before retaining bounds in
  `PdhgReport`; unrelated reports cannot acquire them. Domain-separated solve
  snapshots bind every public diagnostic and the complete trace. Public
  diagnostic mutation makes all verified accessors return `None` and omits
  verified fields from `to_json`; the trace itself is private and exposed only
  as an immutable slice. Certificate admission rejects a retained trace-length
  mismatch in O(1), then re-hashes the complete trace with bounded polling.
- `sizing::size_and_snap` → `CatalogAudit`: areas from yield, EULER
  floors for compression members (solid square `A ≥ √(12|q|l²/π²E)`),
  joint parsimony pruning with MANDATORY least-squares equilibrium
  re-verification on survivors (CG on the normal equations), catalog
  UP-snapping (feasibility preserved by construction), member-by-
  member post-snap re-checks as fs-constraint `Code` rows.
- `rodcheck::rod_buckling_check`: the critical compression member as
  an fs-solid Cosserat rod with a seeded bow, loaded to factor×design
  — stable/bow-ratio outcome (the tfz.14/tfz.15 spot check).

## Invariants

1. Ground rules hold member-by-member and generation is bitwise
   reproducible. Exact-cap admission succeeds; cap-plus-one, malformed parallel
   vectors, noncanonical member identity, inconsistent lengths, unsafe numeric
   state, allocation pressure, and cancellation return structured refusal with
   no partial `GroundStructure` (truss-001 and admission battery).
2. PDHG reaches hand-provable optima (aligned tie `PL/σ`; symmetric
   two-bar `2PL/σ`) to 1e-4 with objective separation < 1e-5,
   equilibrium residual < 1e-5, complementary slackness and observed dual
   feasibility violation < 1e-4 (truss-002). These are numerical oracle checks,
   not by themselves an outward-rounded certificate.
3. A finite optimum interval exists only after both independent certificate
   sides pass. A Neumann contraction proves existence of an exactly feasible
   nonnegative primal split; outward dual slacks prove the lower bound. Tiny
   basis enumeration independently checks the aligned-tie and symmetric
   two-bar optima. Approximate infeasible iterates contribute no raw upper
   bound; rank deficiency, poor conditioning, non-finite arithmetic, budget
   excess, identity mismatch, and cancellation fail closed (truss-002h-k).
4. Densifying the ground structure does not worsen the returned-iterate volume
   beyond the declared diagnostic tolerance
   (truss-003); the Michell closed-form catalogue comparison is a
   LEDGERED PENDING row until its vetted constants land via the
   fs-fab oracle spec — stated, never silently skipped.
5. PDHG cost per (iteration × nnz) is flat across problem sizes
   (spread < 3×) and warm starts reduce iterations on perturbed load
   cases (truss-004; the 10⁶-member wall-clock target is perf-lane
   scope, ledgered).
6. Sizing: post-prune equilibrium re-verified < 1e-6; Euler floors
   active on compression members; post-snap member-by-member audit
   all-pass (truss-005).
7. The rod spot check has teeth: catalog area stable at 1.3× design,
   an under-sized member fails or bows an order harder (truss-006).

## Error model

`GroundRules`, `GroundLimits`, `GroundStructure`, `LayoutCase`, `LayoutLimits`,
and `LayoutLp::try_assemble` return `TrussConstructionError` for invalid input,
parallel-vector shape mismatch, work/retained-byte excess, failed vector
reservation, or observed cancellation. No public ground or layout constructor
panics on caller input or publishes partial state. `LayoutLp::solve` separately
returns `PdhgError` for zero iteration/check intervals, invalid tolerance,
malformed warm-start shape, or non-finite/out-of-domain warm state. The
objective-separation and KKT numbers remain diagnostics. Certificate malformed
state, invalid limits, allocation failure, report substitution, and
cancellation are hard `LayoutCertificateError`s. Sound numerical inability is
`LayoutCertificateStatus::Unavailable` with a typed resource, rank,
conditioning, residual, non-finite, or endpoint refusal; it never fabricates a
wide finite bound. `NaN` catalog area marks an un-satisfiable member in the
audit rather than silently clamping.

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic across runs on a platform (BTree generation, fixed
iteration/basis/pivot order, deterministic solvers and canonical receipt
hashing). Cross-ISA goldens not yet recorded.

## Cancellation behavior

Ground construction and LP assembly poll an explicit `Cx` at deterministic
bounded strides and immediately before publication. Cancellation returns a
structured `Cancelled { stage }` refusal; no partially built authoritative
value escapes. Certificate construction and admission validation, matrix
visits, elimination, interval work, hashing, verification, and final
publication likewise poll at bounded strides. Report admission re-hashes the
complete solver trace with the same deterministic stride before retaining
bounds; the cheap promotion verifier rejects shape or retained-operation-cap
excess before traversing caller arrays. A cancelled attempt clears report
bounds and publishes no proof. The
PDHG solver remains iteration-bounded but does not yet poll `Cx` inside its
fixed synchronous solve loop; its initial private trace snapshot is part of
that same unpolled solve. Only the cancellation-polled admission re-hash can
authorize later certificate retention.

## No-claim boundaries

- SOCP extensions (elastic-compatible layout, stress constraints
  beyond plastic design) — the LP ships; SOCP is the recorded
  successor under the same PDHG surface.
- The vetted Michell closed-form catalogue (0.08-tolerance
  comparisons land with the fs-fab `:oracle (michell …)` spec
  constants).
- 10⁶⁺-member wall-clock budgets (perf lanes; the trend is ledgered
  here).
- 3D ground structures; frame (moment-carrying) layout; connection
  families beyond angle sets; discrete member-count MILP.
- Multi-load-case simultaneous layout (warm starts ship; the
  worst-case envelope LP is follow-up).
- Rank-deficient nonzero equilibrium systems and bases whose Neumann
  contraction cannot be proved remain `Unavailable`, even when some such
  systems are feasible. Generic rectangular exact-feasibility certificates are
  follow-up scope; no residual-containing-zero shortcut is claimed.
- Active-set membership and tropical load-path weights are not implied by an
  optimum interval. They remain estimated until their separate interval proof
  lands.

//! fs-spectral — spectral health monitoring (plan addendum, Proposal 5).
//! Layer: L1.
//!
//! The fixed-iteration gauge-fit/candidate-remainder triage used by MERGE
//! (Proposal 10) and sheaf repair is only as trustworthy as the sheaf
//! Laplacian's SPECTRAL GAP. The gap conditions numerical confidence; it does
//! not certify H¹ or turn a remainder into a structural obstruction. A system
//! that can say "I am becoming
//! numerically unreliable in this region, and here is the reroute" is a
//! different species from one that silently degrades. This crate:
//!
//! - computes a legacy, unauthoritative λ-gap diagnostic for a (small, dense,
//!   symmetric) operator via an in-house Jacobi eigensolver —
//!   [`symmetric_eigenvalues`], [`spectral_gap`];
//! - classifies gap HEALTH with HYSTERESIS thresholds so a marginal region does
//!   not flap between healthy and degraded — [`GapHealthMonitor`];
//! - PROPAGATES low confidence: a degraded gap DEMOTES any downstream color
//!   (verified/validated → estimated) and never promotes — [`propagate`]. This
//!   is the flag Proposal 10's merge outputs MUST surface;
//! - composes per-op AMPLIFICATION factors into an end-to-end CONDITIONING
//!   estimate and gives the representation router a conditioning term, so it
//!   prefers paths that keep the whole pipeline well-posed —
//!   [`compose_conditioning`], [`route`].
//! - validates versioned spectral problem descriptors, proposition-bound
//!   authority, and exact method-family prerequisites — [`admission`];
//! - validates one-way, content-addressed physical-domain crosswalks without
//!   importing higher-layer physical models or inventing reverse maps —
//!   [`adapter`];
//! - validates versioned Maslov--Krein--Evans theorem statements, explicit
//!   hypothesis/implication lattices, convention transforms, and preregistered
//!   falsifiers without treating proof references as theorem authority —
//!   [`bridge`];
//! - validates orthogonal set-valued result truth (authority, algebraic
//!   coverage, cluster/internal separation, projective accounting, and
//!   termination) against the complete admitted problem — [`truth`].
//!
//! Everything is deterministic. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

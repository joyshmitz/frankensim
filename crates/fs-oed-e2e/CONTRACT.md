# CONTRACT: fs-oed-e2e

SensorForge — optimal experimental design that knows when to stop. Layer L4
(ASCENT).

## Purpose and layer

Composes `fs-assimilate` and `fs-exec` (one explicit cancellation context and
private invocation-global poll ledger), `fs-voi` (EVPI + recommend),
`fs-toleralloc` (first-order budget), `fs-evidence` (Estimated lineage), and
`fs-blake3` (bounded canonical identities). Dependencies point downward.

## Public types and semantics

- `Candidate::new(...) -> Result<Candidate, CandidateError>` checks and then
  seals the name, finite truth/prior, non-negative prior variance, and positive
  finite sensor noise/cost. Read-only accessors expose the declaration.
- `run_campaign(&[Candidate], threshold, max_sensors, &Cx) ->
  Result<OedReport, OedError>` validates the threshold, unique candidate
  identities, and explicit synchronous work caps, then CANONICALIZES the
  candidate menu (name-ascending) EXACTLY ONCE at admission (bead
  sj31i.62) before greedily placing VoI-chosen sensors under
  deterministic cancellation checkpoints. Every derived belief/estimate/
  action/report sequence follows canonical order, so campaign outcomes
  and retained artifacts are INVARIANT under caller menu permutation.
- Canonical EVPI representation (bead sj31i.62): estimates live in an
  opaque `CanonicalDesignMenu` whose identity order is verified once
  (one O(n) window scan per posterior refresh, `CanonicalOrderViolated`
  on breakage) and never re-sorted; EVPI evaluates through
  `fs_voi::evpi_by` with NO per-call clone or sort, and the predictive
  quadrature substitutes the target's mean/statistical uncertainty
  through a non-owning, lifetime-bound `MeanOverrideView` (validated
  index and finite payload, `OverrideInvalid` otherwise) — stale
  restoration or cancellation-corrupted scratch state is
  unrepresentable because nothing is mutated. Target lookup is
  O(log n) binary search on the canonical order. The old per-node
  clone-and-sort work was never charged by the work plan; eliminating
  it makes the retained record-visit accounting HONEST without
  changing any admitted/realized work formula, pinned work constant,
  or poll boundary.
- `demo_candidates() -> Result<Vec<Candidate>, CandidateError>` builds the four
  checked candidates whose close top two drive the decision.
- `OedReport` includes the native EVPI trace, posterior summaries, one
  instrument-bound `assimilation_color` per placement, and input-bound final
  variance/EVPI colors so consumers do not need to transcribe the loop.
- Both retained report estimators use identity version 6 (v6 binds the
  CANONICAL candidate sequence — bead sj31i.62). Their canonical
  preimages bind every candidate declaration, threshold and placement cap,
  execution mode, stream/budget context, admitted and realized work shapes,
  poll/planning policy versions and strides, quadrature rule constants, every
  realized output sequence, and both color dispersions.
  Prefixes are `sensorforge-posterior-variance:v6:` and
  `sensorforge-evpi:v6:`; the manifest also locks planning policy v3, poll
  policy v2, `fs-voi` EVPI semantics, record stride 256, and action stride 1.

## Invariants

- Sensor planning uses the same scalar Kalman variance model as execution:
  `P' = PR/(P+R)`, evaluated with an overflow-safe form. The action effect is
  rebuilt after every placement from the current `P` and the candidate's
  declared noise `R`; no fixed sensor reduction is permitted.
- Action value integrates posterior-mean outcomes with a retained deterministic
  nine-point normal Gauss-Hermite rule. Sensors therefore land on candidates
  that are both decision-relevant and informative at their declared noise and
  cost; each completed placement shrinks total posterior variance.
- The campaign evaluates STOP before its placement cap, including when
  `max_sensors == 0`. `decision_robust` is true only when final modeled EVPI is
  at or below the checked threshold; a no-useful-action stop above threshold is
  not mislabeled robust.
- The posterior variance is `Estimated`: the scalar Kalman formula is exact for
  its declared linear-Gaussian model, but neither floating-point roundoff nor
  model-form assumptions carry an interval certificate. The EVPI stop is
  `Estimated`. Both bounded estimator identities commit to the complete ordered
  candidate declarations, threshold, placement cap, realized placement and
  posterior sequences, and canonical assimilation colors.
- Zero total prior variance has fractional reduction `0.0`, not NaN. A
  zero-sensitivity candidate receives `+infinity` allocation, the exact
  unconstrained first-order optimum; positive-sensitivity allocations must be
  positive and finite.
- Deterministic (the worked-campaign readings hit each truth; Kalman variance is
  observation-free; planning quadrature is fixed-order). Equal-mean EVPI inputs
  are canonicalized by candidate identity before the current top-two
  approximation, so caller menu order cannot alter the sensor policy. This does
  not upgrade that approximation into full multi-alternative EVPI.
- With `n` candidates and admitted placement cap `s`, preflight charges setup
  `5n`, each complete placement `11n^2+5n+2`, maximum finalization
  `18n+6s+5`, and their checked sum. For `p` completed placements, `a` action
  rounds, `m` positive-prior candidates, and `d=a-p` (necessarily zero or one),
  realized accounting replaces the maximum tail with
  `13n+5m+6p+5` and charges an incomplete action round, when present, as
  `d(11n^2+2n)`. Publication requires exact equality with that realized shape
  and never exceeds the admitted shape.
  Admission also requires `11n^2*s <= MAX_CAMPAIGN_EVALUATIONS`.

## Error model

No documented input panic. Candidate and campaign rejection is structured as
`CandidateError` / `OedError`; lower-layer assimilation failures retain their
`AssimError` source. `Cancelled`, `AssimilationCancelled`, ordinary nested
`Assimilation`, and `WorkPlanMismatch` remain distinct, so nested quota or
cancellation cannot be laundered as a scientific refusal. Resource admission
caps candidates, placements, and the quadratic action/design work multiplied
by the retained expectation-rule cost before campaign allocation or iteration.
Derived posterior variances, posterior means, expected EVPI, and value-per-cost
must remain finite.

## Determinism class

Same-process deterministic for a fixed implementation/toolchain manifest (G5).
Equal value-per-cost actions use their canonical action identity as the
order-independent tie-break. This is not a cross-ISA identity promise.

## Cancellation behavior

Synchronous and cancellation-aware. A private invocation-global ledger derives
its poll quota once from `Cx`; only campaign checkpoints and the nested
assimilation transaction may decrease it. `Cx` is polled at deterministic
admission, action (every action), 256-record, assimilation-commit, refresh,
finalization, identity, and publication boundaries. Campaign cancellation,
nested assimilation cancellation, or quota exhaustion never publishes a
partial report. Deadline and cost-quota enforcement remain cross-workflow
follow-up scope: those budget fields are identity-bound provenance but only the
poll ledger is consumed locally. A scratch posterior is committed only after
nested assimilation and the placement-commit checkpoint both succeed; final
publication additionally requires both identity manifests and exact realized
work reconciliation.

## Unsafe boundary

None; `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/oed.rs` plus the crate unit tests (G0/G3/G4/G5): decision-relevant
placement and stopping; low-noise versus high-noise ordering under adversarial
menu permutations; predicted/realized Kalman variance agreement and extreme
finite noise limits; initial STOP at a
zero placement cap; full-report determinism; adversarial candidate/campaign
input rejection; zero-variance behavior; cancellation/poll bounds;
unmeasured-input evidence binding; instrument-bound assimilation lineage;
admitted/realized work locks; hostile-maximum admission; nested and finalization
quota sweeps; execution/budget/work identity binding; exact quadrature-bit
semantics; and sealed-output identity movement.

## No-claim boundaries

- Scalar (diagonal) beliefs and a Gaussian EVPI model; the greedy VoI policy is
  not claimed globally optimal. Nine-point Gauss-Hermite outcome integration is
  an Estimated deterministic approximation and currently has no certified
  quadrature-remainder bound. The precision budget uses a prior-std sensitivity
  proxy.
- `decision_robust` is a modeled EVPI criterion, not a physical decision
  certificate or independent validation. The worked campaign currently injects
  declared truth as its deterministic reading; a production measurement
  provider and stochastic outcome stream are separate required work.
- Logical-work and poll counts do not claim instruction counts, wall-clock or
  memory bounds, pause/resume support, deadline/cost enforcement, drain latency,
  or a 200-microsecond cancellation guarantee. Identity roots are
  replay/integrity bindings, not authenticated provenance or proof of global
  policy optimality.
- The G5 battery is same-process and fixed-manifest evidence; it does not claim
  cross-version or cross-ISA floating-point identity. As of identity v6 the
  report identity IS caller-menu-permutation-invariant (the preimage binds the
  canonical candidate sequence); v5 artifacts that bound a non-canonical
  declaration order remain valid only under their own version prefix.
- sj31i.62 remaining scope: byte-level charging of comparison/override/hash/log
  work and fallible allocation admission for the campaign's retained outputs
  are not yet implemented; the current work plan still counts bounded record
  visits (now an HONEST count, since the uncharged clone-and-sort work was
  eliminated rather than charged).

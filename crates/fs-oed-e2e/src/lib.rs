//! fs-oed-e2e — SensorForge: optimal experimental design that knows when to
//! stop. Layer: L4 (ASCENT).
//!
//! # The campaign
//!
//! You must pick the best of several designs, but their performances are only
//! estimated; you can spend sensors to sharpen them. Which do you measure, and
//! when have you measured enough? This answers both with evidence, composing
//! crates never designed to meet:
//!
//! - **Kalman fusion** ([`fs_assimilate`]): each candidate is a Gaussian belief;
//!   a sensor reading is fused with the exact scalar Kalman update, shrinking that
//!   candidate's posterior variance.
//! - **Value of information** ([`fs_voi`]): at each step the Expected Value of
//!   Perfect Information scores the decision's ambiguity; the campaign's
//!   cancellation-aware action-value reduction places the next sensor on the
//!   candidate whose measurement most sharpens the DECISION (not the
//!   most-uncertain candidate), and says STOP the instant EVPI falls below
//!   threshold — the design choice is already robust.
//! - **Budget allocation** ([`fs_toleralloc`]): the measurement-precision budget
//!   is then distributed cost-optimally across candidates by sensitivity.
//! - **Honest colors** ([`fs_evidence`]): posterior variance and EVPI remain
//!   `Estimated`; their bounded identities commit to every campaign input and
//!   every instrument-bound assimilation candidate.
//!
//! Deterministic (sensor readings hit each candidate's true value; the Kalman
//! variance update is observation-independent). No dependencies beyond the
//! composed crates.

//! CutFEM-quadtree marquee conformance (the 2D analogue of the planned

//! volume with ZERO mesh rebuilds (the marquee property — asserted
//! from the run log); topology EVOLVES (void components change or
//! boundary-side nodes flip) without any remesh; the DWR cut-band gate
//! concentrates refinement near the design boundary; the benchmark envelope is
//! recorded as evidence with per-iteration timing (the

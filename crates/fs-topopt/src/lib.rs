//! fs-topopt — density-based topology optimization (plan §9.5 [S]).
//! Layer: L4 ASCENT.
//!
//! SIMP with the modern hygiene stack: Helmholtz PDE filtering for
//! mesh-independent length-scale control (REUSING the Poisson
//! machinery — one solver, two jobs), Heaviside projection with β
//! continuation (crisp designs without premature lock-in),
//! penalization continuation, EXACT chain-rule sensitivities through
//! the whole density pipeline (SIMP ∘ projection ∘ filter — every
//! stage linear or with a closed-form derivative, verified against
//! finite differences at multiple continuation stages), and the
//! classic optimality-criteria driver for compliance/volume
//! (fs-ascent's augmented Lagrangian is the general constrained
//! path; OC is the documented default for this problem class).
//!
//! NAMING: the plan's atlas used "fs-topo" for this stack; that crate
//! name now carries the L2 topology-CERTIFICATE machinery
//! (persistence, cubical homology), so the optimization stack lives
//! here as fs-topopt. CutFEM-octree execution (topology evolving with
//! ZERO remeshing) is the marquee follow-up lane recorded on the
//! bead.

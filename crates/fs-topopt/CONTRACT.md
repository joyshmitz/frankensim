# fs-topopt CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: **L4 ASCENT** (deps: fs-adjoint/fs-solver/fs-feec L3,
fs-ascent L4, fs-material L3, fs-la/fs-sparse L1, fs-math L0,
fs-rep-mesh L2). Density-based topology optimization (plan §9.5 [S]):
SIMP with the modern hygiene stack — Helmholtz PDE filtering,
Heaviside projection with continuation, exact chain-rule
sensitivities, and the classical optimality-criteria driver.

NAMING: the plan's atlas used "fs-topo" for this stack; that crate
name carries the L2 topology-CERTIFICATE machinery (persistence,
cubical homology), so the optimization stack lives here.

## Public types and semantics

- `DensityElasticity` — matrix-free K(ρ̄) = Σ_c E_c·K_c with per-cell
  UNIT-modulus 12×12 blocks (fs-material `IsotropicElastic` tangent ×
  fs-feec barycentric-gradient B-matrices) kept separate for the
  exact chain rule; Dirichlet dofs handled by identity-on-fixed
  masking (SPD on the full vector space); `cell_energies` =
  uᵀK_c u per cell (the compliance sensitivity kernel).
- `DensityFilter` — Helmholtz filter: volume-weighted cell→vertex
  scatter, (M + r²K)⁻¹M solve on the FULL vertex space (natural BCs —
  the correct filter behavior: no boundary droop), vertex→cell
  gather. Linear; `apply_transpose` is the exact chain-rule pullback
  (adjointness ⟨Fx, w⟩ = ⟨x, Fᵀw⟩ G0-tested; constants preserved to
  solver tolerance). One assembled operator, built once.
- `heaviside`/`heaviside_derivative` — tanh projection with β/η,
  exact endpoints, monotone, closed-form slope; tanh through the
  strict exp kernel (no platform libm in the pipeline).
- `DesignPipeline` — ρ → filter → projection → SIMP
  (E_min + (1−E_min)·ρ̄^p) with `pullback` reversing the chain
  exactly, and `compliance_and_gradient` exploiting self-adjointness
  (λ = u ⇒ dc/dE_c = −u_cᵀK_cu_c: ZERO extra solves — stated and
  FD-verified).
- `optimality_criteria` — the classical OC driver (documented choice
  for compliance/volume; fs-ascent's augmented Lagrangian is the
  general path): multiplicative update with move limits, volume
  multiplier by fixed 80-step bisection on the PROJECTED volume —
  fully deterministic, whole runs replay bitwise.
- `eigenfreq` — generalized eigenproblems K(ρ̄)φ = λM(ρ̄)φ (per-cell
  consistent P1 mass blocks; Cholesky reduction + Jacobi at fixture
  scale), exact eigenvalue design gradients through the full chain,
  the MASS-INTERPOLATION trap handled (linear mass above ρ = 0.1,
  continuously-matched ρ⁶ below — spurious void modes gated by
  regression), smooth-min aggregation with exact weighted gradients
  for CLUSTERED eigenvalues (FD-verified near a designed crossing).
- `stress` — relaxed von Mises measures with qp-RELAXATION (exponent
  q < penal; void cells cannot drive the constraint — share and
  floor-stability gated), p-norm aggregation with the ADAPTIVE
  normalization c = σ_max/PN reported per evaluation, and the
  NON-self-adjoint design gradient (one extra adjoint solve via
  `stress_pullback`, cross terms by the polarization identity on
  cell energies).
- `robust::{RobustPipeline, robust_optimality_criteria}` — the
  erode/dilate three-field formulation: one filter, three projections
  (η ± δ), POINTWISE-ORDERED realizations (tested); minimize ERODED
  compliance s.t. volume on the DILATED field whose target is adapted
  (DAMPED, 0.3 blend) so the NOMINAL design carries the budget — the
  undamped adaptation measured a period-2 limit cycle on cold starts
  (kept as a regression probe); reports carry the erosion-retention
  ratio vol(eroded)/vol(nominal), the measured minimum-length-scale
  signal.

- `marquee` module (bead b7d0; [F], behind `cutfem-marquee`): the
  CutFEM-quadtree topology marquee, the 2D analogue of the planned octree
  lane. `DensityDesign` (nodal densities;
  the SOLID region {ρ > ½} IS the CutFEM domain via the bilinear
  CutSdf with an exact-containment enclosure, plus a deterministic
  non-cryptographic `state_witness` for trace correlation), `run_marquee` (the
  volume-to-point heat fixture: interface-flux redistribution with a
  BAND-LOCAL volume projection, DWR-gated band refinement, an explicit final
  re-solve on the returned design, and zero rebuilds structurally),
  `refine_dwr_cut_band` (an estimator-agnostic,
  one-step cut-band planning policy over `CellKey` indicators, returning
  a `DwrBandDecision` reason, versioned mass evidence, analysis headroom,
  target leaf delta, and the ACTUAL halo/balance split count; invalid levels,
  non-leaf keys, non-finite indicators/masses,
  and non-finite SDF enclosures return `InvalidFemInput` before
  caller-visible mutation), `DWR_CUT_BAND_POLICY_VERSION` and
  `DWR_CUT_BAND_MASS_GATE` (the explicit policy identity and strict 0.15
  gate), `void_components`
  (topology witness), `min_feature_cells` (the medial-axis-class thickness oracle).
  The `run_marquee` refinement argument is an enable flag: each enabled
  iteration may advance the whole band by at most one level; it is not a
  requested split budget.
  HARD-WON INVARIANTS from development, all conformance-guarded:
  fs-cutfem's ghost penalty demands the cut band AND ITS ONE-CELL HALO
  at a uniform level (`halo_cut`), conformed after EVERY design update
  because the interface moves; the next `Space::build` verifies rather than
  silently repairs that invariant; interface membership is a NEIGHBOR SIGN
  CHANGE, not a |φ| threshold (φ is a density gap, not a distance);
  DWR mass is classified against the EXACT solved/estimated design
  snapshot, then carried by an exact-grid-generation receipt that may
  authorize one level for the post-update design's band — old indicators
  are never reclassified against a new geometry; every post-update boundary
  is then conformed to the already-authorized level, including the final
  iteration when no later pre-solve repair exists;
  flux probes project THROUGH the interface so void-side nodes read
  real flux; and the volume projection lives ON THE BAND — a global
  shift silently fills voids from the inside.

## Invariants

- Every stage of the density chain has an exact derivative; the
  composed sensitivity is FD-verified at MULTIPLE continuation
  stages (p = 1 → 3, β = 1 → 8) per the acceptance.
- The filter preserves constants and is symmetric in the
  volume-weighted pairing (mesh-independent length scale r).
- OC keeps designs in [1e−3, 1] with move limits; the volume
  constraint tracks the projected design.

## Error model

Structured panics on solver failures and invalid materials
(modeling errors). Optimization outcomes are reported traces
(compliance, volume, final change), never silent.
The public DWR band-planning helper is fail-closed: it validates its
level and every entry in the supplied indicator map, then plans recursive
halo refinement on a
clone, so a structured input refusal leaves both the caller's grid and
band level unchanged. The marquee's split-phase path additionally binds the
advance receipt to the exact ordered leaf set, maximum level, prior band
level, and policy version; a stale-grid receipt refuses before mutation.
Obsolete policy-version receipts likewise refuse before mutation.
Every iteration row names its analysis and post-update target generations,
with non-cryptographic state witnesses and separately labeled metrics. The
report re-solves compliance on the final conformed grid, so
`final_compliance` describes the returned `design`, not the prior analysis
snapshot.
The marquee flux probes read the solved field only through the canonical
fail-closed `fs_cutfem::Space::sample_scalar` (bead ay40): missing or
non-finite active nodal evidence propagates as
`CutFemError::InvalidFemInput` out of `run_marquee` instead of reading
as a plausible zero flux; a certified-Outside leaf reads the
homogeneous Dirichlet exterior u = 0 as an explicit mapping, not a
fallback.

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic: fixed bisection schedules, deterministic solves
throughout; a WHOLE topology-optimization run replays bitwise
(G5-tested). Golden FNV-64 over pipeline stages, compliance
gradient, and a short OC run: `0x772a_2f8c_a720_dd64`; robust
three-field golden `0x519a_41e3_466e_4b7d`. Recorded on
Apple M4 Pro, verified on Threadripper (x86_64).

## Cancellation behavior

Iteration-granular through the resumable fs-solver states; OC
iterations are bounded and the driver can stop between them. Cx
wiring is driver scope.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `unsafe_code = "deny"`.

## Feature flags

- `cutfem-marquee` [F] (default OFF, bead b7d0) — the CutFEM-quadtree
  marquee topology lane (`dep:fs-cutfem`, `dep:fs-dwr`, `dep:fs-ivl`);
  gates the `marquee` integration target.

## Conformance tests

`tests/topopt_battery.rs` (8 cases): filter G0 laws (linearity ≤
1e−9, transpose adjointness ≤ 1e−9, constants preserved); projection
G0 (exact endpoints, monotone on a 100-point sweep, slope vs FD ≤
1e−8); FULL-CHAIN sensitivity vs FD at three continuation stages
(rel ≤ 2e−4 through solve+SIMP+projection+filter); OC cantilever
(kuhn(3), fixed face + edge load): compliance reduced ≥ 20%, volume
within 0.03 of the 0.4 target, design range > 0.5 (not gray), and
the ENTIRE run replaying bitwise; three-field pointwise ordering on
random designs + eroded-compliance sensitivity FD gate (rel ≤ 2e−4);
robust OC vs the non-robust baseline AUDITED WITH THE SAME
three-field probe — eroded compliance descends, volumes ordered,
nominal volume on budget, and erosion retention at least matching
the baseline (the min-length-scale claim, measured); EIGENFREQUENCY —
aggregate gradient vs FD through the whole chain (rel 1.9e−10),
clustered aggregate FD-verified near the symmetric-bending
near-crossing (3.0e−8), spurious-void-mode gate (λ_min stays at
9.3e−2 on a mostly-void design), +67% λ_agg ascent demo at fixed
volume; STRESS — aggregate gradient FD at two continuation stages
(≤1.3e−8; non-self-adjoint path), singularity-trap regression (void
share 0.000% of σ_max AND the gradient FD-verifiable AT the void
floor), −22% max-stress descent demo at fixed volume; FOUR cross-ISA
golden hashes (pipeline, robust, eigenfrequency
`0xbb7e_5ad3_851a_2bf1`, stress `0xc539_ad97_34d8_1b66`). Plus
`tests/probe_robust.rs`: the limit-cycle regression. Feature-gated
`tests/marquee.rs` additionally covers the heat solve/update/refine loop,
zero rebuilds, cut-band concentration, estimator-time gate evidence,
monotone one-level headroom, exact `leaf_delta = 3 * splits` accounting,
and deterministic synthetic
`CellKey` indicators driving `refine_dwr_cut_band` for exactly one
planning step. G3 checks show that indicator negation, exact power-of-two
scaling, reverse insertion, and within-partition mass-preserving
redistribution preserve authorization and target topology.
The iteration log emits policy version, cut/total mass and fraction, band
levels, exhaustive decision reason, analysis/target design witnesses and
metrics, target leaf counts, policy splits, post-update motion-conformance
splits, the fully conformed target-grid leaf count, and their reconstructed
total. Leaf-count chaining, together with the split-only implementation and
absence of an intervening grid mutation, accounts for continuity into each
next analysis and the final re-solve; cardinality alone is not claimed as a
topology-identity certificate. Non-cryptographic design witnesses correlate
each target with the next analysis snapshot and the returned design. The
returned design receives an explicit finite final solve.
The battery separately pins disabled, zero-mass, strict-threshold,
and exhausted-headroom no-op reasons; invalid-level,
non-finite-indicator/accumulated-mass/recursive-enclosure, and non-leaf-key
cases assert structured refusal with no grid or band-level mutation. The
literal vector integration uses `estimate_elasticity_compliance` on an
off-grid embedded disk large enough to retain coarse interior active leaves,
and passes its UNMODIFIED real vector indicator map into the same helper for
two consecutive cycles. Each cycle asserts authentic cut-mass admission,
positive actual halo/balance splits, a mixed-active-level vector re-solve, and
bit-identical structure, coefficients, reconstructed nodes, and compliance on
replay; coarse/enriched compliance and estimator metadata are emitted per
cycle.

## No-claim boundaries

- Scope: compliance/volume, robust three-field, eigenfrequency, and
  stress-aggregate objectives on FIXED kuhn meshes. The medial-axis
  thickness oracle (geometry-layer audit) and the CutFEM-quadtree
  heat marquee (zero remeshing + DWR-gated cut-band adaptivity on its
  recorded volume-to-point fixture) are the feature-gated extension;
  elasticity benchmark envelopes remain outside this contract.
- Eigen solves are dense (fixture scale); LOBPCG-scale pencils join
  via fs-solid stability's machinery when the consumer needs them.
- Stress constraints ship as the aggregate + gradient; the
  constrained DRIVER (AL with adaptive c_k updates per iteration)
  composes from fs-ascent's augmented Lagrangian at the consumer.
- OC is the compliance/volume driver; MMA is not implemented
  (fs-ascent AL is the general constrained path — documented
  choice).
- No multi-load/worst-case formulations, no continuation SCHEDULER
  (drivers own β/p ramps; the primitives take fixed parameters).

## No-claim boundaries (marquee)

- Heat-conduction (volume-to-point) benchmark class: the recorded
  compliance envelope is THIS fixture's golden band; no MBB/cantilever
  ELASTICITY compliance envelope is claimed here.
- The shared refinement helper accepts indicators from scalar or vector
  estimators. Its real-vector integration proves exactly two deterministic
  estimator-to-policy-to-graded-re-solve cycles on the recorded embedded-disk
  fixture. This is not an elasticity optimization benchmark, a general
  adaptive stopping policy, or a certified DWR bound. The logged
  `eta_signed / (J_h2 - J_h)` value remains an enriched-delta diagnostic, not
  an independent-reference effectivity claim.
- Per-iteration wall times are DEBUG-build measurements, labeled; the
  interactive-cadence targets are perf-CI's gates.
- The flux redistribution is a smeared shape-derivative heuristic with
  measured descent, not a certified gradient (the certified route is
  the marquee-demo crate's exact bilinear identity).
- Split concentration is bounded by the halo contract at ~2/3, not the
  0.8 a halo-free marker could reach — the ceiling is the solver's
  ghost-penalty stencil. The 0.60 final-snapshot threshold is a recorded
  fixture golden across its short moving-boundary trajectory; the stronger
  advancing and non-advancing motion tests derive the target halo refinement
  independently, require exact leaf-set equality, and build the next scalar
  space on the conformed result.
- The heat marquee gates refinement on the fraction of absolute DWR mass
  carried by zero-straddling cells of the SAME snapshot that produced those
  indicators. This is a global one-level authorization, not Dörfler/top-k
  cell marking. Its target is the post-update cut band and halo used by the
  next solve; no claim is made that old per-cell residuals localize error on
  the moved geometry. It does not multiply indicators by `|grad rho|`, and
  no such weighting is claimed. Absolute split counts are fixture outcomes,
  not policy invariants: the corrected independent coarse-adjoint estimator
  can legitimately change their value while the versioned gate, structural
  accounting, and boundary-concentration invariants remain intact.
- `state_witness` is deterministic forensic correlation metadata only. It is
  not collision-resistant, not a content address, and not authority for
  scientific identity; the full `DensityDesign` remains the artifact of
  record.

# fs-topopt CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: **L4 ASCENT** (deps: fs-adjoint/fs-solver/fs-feec L3,
fs-ascent L4, fs-material L3, fs-la/fs-sparse L1, fs-math L0,
fs-rep-mesh L2). Density-based topology optimization (plan §9.5 [S]):
SIMP with the modern hygiene stack — Helmholtz PDE filtering,
Heaviside projection with continuation, exact chain-rule
sensitivities, and the classical optimality-criteria driver.

NAMING: the plan's atlas used "fs-topo" for this stack; that crate
name carries the L2 topology-CERTIFICATE machinery (persistence,
cubical homology), so the optimization stack lives here.

## Public types and semantics

- `DensityElasticity` — matrix-free K(ρ̄) = Σ_c E_c·K_c with per-cell
  UNIT-modulus 12×12 blocks (fs-material `IsotropicElastic` tangent ×
  fs-feec barycentric-gradient B-matrices) kept separate for the
  exact chain rule; Dirichlet dofs handled by identity-on-fixed
  masking (SPD on the full vector space); `cell_energies` =
  uᵀK_c u per cell (the compliance sensitivity kernel).
- `DensityFilter` — Helmholtz filter: volume-weighted cell→vertex
  scatter, (M + r²K)⁻¹M solve on the FULL vertex space (natural BCs —
  the correct filter behavior: no boundary droop), vertex→cell
  gather. Linear; `apply_transpose` is the exact chain-rule pullback
  (adjointness ⟨Fx, w⟩ = ⟨x, Fᵀw⟩ G0-tested; constants preserved to
  solver tolerance). One assembled operator, built once.
- `heaviside`/`heaviside_derivative` — tanh projection with β/η,
  exact endpoints, monotone, closed-form slope; tanh through the
  strict exp kernel (no platform libm in the pipeline).
- `DesignPipeline` — ρ → filter → projection → SIMP
  (E_min + (1−E_min)·ρ̄^p) with `pullback` reversing the chain
  exactly, and `compliance_and_gradient` exploiting self-adjointness
  (λ = u ⇒ dc/dE_c = −u_cᵀK_cu_c: ZERO extra solves — stated and
  FD-verified).
- `optimality_criteria` — the classical OC driver (documented choice
  for compliance/volume; fs-ascent's augmented Lagrangian is the
  general path): multiplicative update with move limits, volume
  multiplier by fixed 80-step bisection on the PROJECTED volume —
  fully deterministic, whole runs replay bitwise.
- `eigenfreq` — generalized eigenproblems K(ρ̄)φ = λM(ρ̄)φ (per-cell
  consistent P1 mass blocks; Cholesky reduction + Jacobi at fixture
  scale), exact eigenvalue design gradients through the full chain,
  the MASS-INTERPOLATION trap handled (linear mass above ρ = 0.1,
  continuously-matched ρ⁶ below — spurious void modes gated by
  regression), smooth-min aggregation with exact weighted gradients
  for CLUSTERED eigenvalues (FD-verified near a designed crossing).
- `stress` — relaxed von Mises measures with qp-RELAXATION (exponent
  q < penal; void cells cannot drive the constraint — share and
  floor-stability gated), p-norm aggregation with the ADAPTIVE
  normalization c = σ_max/PN reported per evaluation, and the
  NON-self-adjoint design gradient (one extra adjoint solve via
  `stress_pullback`, cross terms by the polarization identity on
  cell energies).
- `robust::{RobustPipeline, robust_optimality_criteria}` — the
  erode/dilate three-field formulation: one filter, three projections
  (η ± δ), POINTWISE-ORDERED realizations (tested); minimize ERODED
  compliance s.t. volume on the DILATED field whose target is adapted
  (DAMPED, 0.3 blend) so the NOMINAL design carries the budget — the
  undamped adaptation measured a period-2 limit cycle on cold starts
  (kept as a regression probe); reports carry the erosion-retention
  ratio vol(eroded)/vol(nominal), the measured minimum-length-scale
  signal.

- `marquee` module (bead b7d0; [F], behind `cutfem-marquee`): the
  CutFEM-octree topology marquee. `DensityDesign` (nodal densities;
  the SOLID region {ρ > ½} IS the CutFEM domain via the bilinear
  CutSdf with an exact-containment enclosure), `run_marquee` (the
  volume-to-point heat fixture: interface-flux redistribution with a
  BAND-LOCAL volume projection, DWR-gated band refinement, zero
  rebuilds structurally), `refine_dwr_cut_band` (an estimator-agnostic,
  one-step cut-band planning policy over `CellKey` indicators, returning
  the ACTUAL halo/balance split count; invalid levels, non-leaf keys,
  non-finite indicators/masses, and non-finite SDF enclosures return
  `InvalidFemInput` before caller-visible mutation), `void_components`
  (topology witness), `min_feature_cells` (the medial-axis-class thickness oracle).
  The `run_marquee` refinement argument is an enable flag: each enabled
  iteration may advance the whole band by at most one level; it is not a
  requested split budget.
  HARD-WON INVARIANTS from development, all conformance-guarded:
  fs-cutfem's ghost penalty demands the cut band AND ITS ONE-CELL HALO
  at a uniform level (`halo_cut`), re-conformed EVERY iteration
  because the interface moves; interface membership is a NEIGHBOR SIGN
  CHANGE, not a |φ| threshold (φ is a density gap, not a distance);
  flux probes project THROUGH the interface so void-side nodes read
  real flux; and the volume projection lives ON THE BAND — a global
  shift silently fills voids from the inside.

## Invariants

- Every stage of the density chain has an exact derivative; the
  composed sensitivity is FD-verified at MULTIPLE continuation
  stages (p = 1 → 3, β = 1 → 8) per the acceptance.
- The filter preserves constants and is symmetric in the
  volume-weighted pairing (mesh-independent length scale r).
- OC keeps designs in [1e−3, 1] with move limits; the volume
  constraint tracks the projected design.

## Error model

Structured panics on solver failures and invalid materials
(modeling errors). Optimization outcomes are reported traces
(compliance, volume, final change), never silent.
The public DWR band-planning helper is fail-closed: it validates its
complete supplied indicator map and plans recursive halo refinement on a
clone, so a structured input refusal leaves both the caller's grid and
band level unchanged.

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic: fixed bisection schedules, deterministic solves
throughout; a WHOLE topology-optimization run replays bitwise
(G5-tested). Golden FNV-64 over pipeline stages, compliance
gradient, and a short OC run: `0x772a_2f8c_a720_dd64`; robust
three-field golden `0x519a_41e3_466e_4b7d`. Recorded on
Apple M4 Pro, verified on Threadripper (x86_64).

## Cancellation behavior

Iteration-granular through the resumable fs-solver states; OC
iterations are bounded and the driver can stop between them. Cx
wiring is driver scope.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `unsafe_code = "deny"`.

## Feature flags

- `cutfem-marquee` [F] (default OFF, bead b7d0) — the CutFEM-octree
  marquee topology lane (`dep:fs-cutfem`, `dep:fs-dwr`, `dep:fs-ivl`);
  gates the `marquee` integration target.

## Conformance tests

`tests/topopt_battery.rs` (8 cases): filter G0 laws (linearity ≤
1e−9, transpose adjointness ≤ 1e−9, constants preserved); projection
G0 (exact endpoints, monotone on a 100-point sweep, slope vs FD ≤
1e−8); FULL-CHAIN sensitivity vs FD at three continuation stages
(rel ≤ 2e−4 through solve+SIMP+projection+filter); OC cantilever
(kuhn(3), fixed face + edge load): compliance reduced ≥ 20%, volume
within 0.03 of the 0.4 target, design range > 0.5 (not gray), and
the ENTIRE run replaying bitwise; three-field pointwise ordering on
random designs + eroded-compliance sensitivity FD gate (rel ≤ 2e−4);
robust OC vs the non-robust baseline AUDITED WITH THE SAME
three-field probe — eroded compliance descends, volumes ordered,
nominal volume on budget, and erosion retention at least matching
the baseline (the min-length-scale claim, measured); EIGENFREQUENCY —
aggregate gradient vs FD through the whole chain (rel 1.9e−10),
clustered aggregate FD-verified near the symmetric-bending
near-crossing (3.0e−8), spurious-void-mode gate (λ_min stays at
9.3e−2 on a mostly-void design), +67% λ_agg ascent demo at fixed
volume; STRESS — aggregate gradient FD at two continuation stages
(≤1.3e−8; non-self-adjoint path), singularity-trap regression (void
share 0.000% of σ_max AND the gradient FD-verifiable AT the void
floor), −22% max-stress descent demo at fixed volume; FOUR cross-ISA
golden hashes (pipeline, robust, eigenfrequency
`0xbb7e_5ad3_851a_2bf1`, stress `0xc539_ad97_34d8_1b66`). Plus
`tests/probe_robust.rs`: the limit-cycle regression. Feature-gated
`tests/marquee.rs` additionally covers the heat solve/update/refine loop,
zero rebuilds, cut-band concentration, and deterministic synthetic
`CellKey` indicators driving `refine_dwr_cut_band` for exactly one
planning step, including the disabled no-op path; invalid-level,
non-finite-indicator/accumulated-mass/recursive-enclosure, and non-leaf-key
cases assert structured refusal with no grid or band-level mutation. The
literal heat-parity integration uses `estimate_elasticity_compliance` on
an embedded disk whose below-cell-width radius and off-grid center are chosen
so every active coarse indicator cell is cut by construction, and passes its
UNMODIFIED real vector indicator map into the same helper; it asserts the
exact total/cut marking mass, one band-level advance, actual halo splits,
and records coarse/enriched compliances plus estimator and cut-mass metadata.

## No-claim boundaries

- Scope: compliance/volume, robust three-field, eigenfrequency, and
  stress-aggregate objectives on FIXED kuhn meshes. The medial-axis
  thickness oracle (geometry-layer audit) and the CutFEM-octree
  heat marquee (zero remeshing + DWR-gated cut-band adaptivity on its
  recorded volume-to-point fixture) are the feature-gated extension;
  elasticity benchmark envelopes remain outside this contract.
- Eigen solves are dense (fixture scale); LOBPCG-scale pencils join
  via fs-solid stability's machinery when the consumer needs them.
- Stress constraints ship as the aggregate + gradient; the
  constrained DRIVER (AL with adaptive c_k updates per iteration)
  composes from fs-ascent's augmented Lagrangian at the consumer.
- OC is the compliance/volume driver; MMA is not implemented
  (fs-ascent AL is the general constrained path — documented
  choice).
- No multi-load/worst-case formulations, no continuation SCHEDULER
  (drivers own β/p ramps; the primitives take fixed parameters).

## No-claim boundaries (marquee)

- Heat-conduction (volume-to-point) benchmark class: the recorded
  compliance envelope is THIS fixture's golden band; no MBB/cantilever
  ELASTICITY compliance envelope is claimed here.
- The shared refinement helper accepts indicators from scalar or vector
  estimators. Its real-vector integration proves the estimator-to-policy
  handoff and one graded planning-grid split only. Vector CutFEM currently
  refuses mixed-level active grids, so there is no claim of a graded
  elasticity solve, much less a complete solve-estimate-refine-re-solve
  vector loop. The logged `eta_signed / (J_h2 - J_h)` value is an enriched-
  delta diagnostic, not an independent-reference effectivity claim.
- Per-iteration wall times are DEBUG-build measurements, labeled; the
  interactive-cadence targets are perf-CI's gates.
- The flux redistribution is a smeared shape-derivative heuristic with
  measured descent, not a certified gradient (the certified route is
  the marquee-demo crate's exact bilinear identity).
- Split concentration is bounded by the halo contract at ~2/3, not the
  0.8 a halo-free marker could reach — the ceiling is the solver's
  ghost-penalty stencil, documented in the test.
- The heat marquee gates refinement on the fraction of absolute DWR mass
  carried by zero-straddling cells. It does not multiply indicators by
  `|grad rho|`, and no such weighting is claimed.

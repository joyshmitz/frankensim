//! fs-verify — the certified-speculation VERIFIER (bead lmp4.1, the
//! addendum's SINGLE research bet). Layer: L3.
//!
//! The verifier is what lets untrusted proposers be maximally
//! aggressive: the accept test is CERTIFIED, so correctness never
//! depends on the learned component. For the elliptic class,
//! equilibrated-flux a-posteriori estimators (Prager–Synge) give
//! GUARANTEED, CONSTANT-FREE upper bounds on the energy-norm error —
//! the hard analysis is purchased from the literature, and the
//! remaining risk (floating-point rounding) is retired by
//! outward-rounded interval evaluation over mathematically exact
//! quadrature. An accepted candidate carries a VERIFIED color; a
//! rejected or unbounded evaluation carries NOTHING (fail closed).
//!
//! v0 class: 1D elliptic with polynomial manufactured solutions (the
//! quadrature-exactness backbone). The 2D FEEC H(div) equilibration
//! rides fs-feec as the successor — CONTRACT no-claim. The nonlinear
//! class gets the honest fallback: candidates are WARM STARTS with
//! measured iteration savings, never certificates.

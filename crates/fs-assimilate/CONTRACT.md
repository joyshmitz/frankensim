# CONTRACT: fs-assimilate

Data assimilation as a living belief (plan addendum, Proposal 11): checked
sensor readings produce a content-addressed posterior candidate for a proposed
regime. Assimilation itself does not claim experimental validation.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L4 (inference/UQ). Depends on `fs-evidence` (`Color` and
`ValidityDomain`), `fs-exec` (explicit `Cx`, mode, stream identity, and
budgets), `fs-ivl` (outward-rounded PSD admission certificates), and the
in-tree `fs-blake3` identity primitive. This is the checked, deterministic
linear-Gaussian core of weak-constraint assimilation.

## Public types and semantics

- `Belief` — a Gaussian state belief with private state. `new(..., &Cx)`,
  `scalar`, `diagonal(..., &Cx)`, and `validate(&Cx)` return `Result`;
  admission requires a non-empty finite mean and a finite, square, symmetric,
  positive-semidefinite covariance within the `MAX_DENSE_STATE_DIM` v0
  envelope. `mean` and
  `covariance` expose read-only slices; `component_mean` and `variance` are
  bounds-checked.
- `diagonal_belief_invocation_resources(dimension)` returns the checked typed
  work, poll, cost, evaluation, conservative live-memory, and retained-output
  grant for diagonal construction. `Belief::diagonal_budgeted(..., &Cx,
  &mut ChildBudget)` consumes only that affine parent-issued grant.
- `Observation` — a private, checked scalar reading
  `value = operator·state + noise`. `Observation::new` rejects empty, all-zero,
  and non-finite operators; non-finite readings; non-positive noise; and
  malformed instrument leaf identities.
- `point_sensor(component, dim, value, instrument_noise, instrument) -> Result`
  — the REGISTRATION-FREE observation (`operator = e_component`), rejecting
  zero dimensions and out-of-range components.
- `scan_observation(..., registration_var, ...) -> Result` — adds a finite,
  non-negative registration variance to strictly positive instrument noise and
  rejects overflow of the total (R8).
- `misfit(&Belief, &[Observation], &Cx) -> Result<f64, AssimError>` —
  `Σ (h·mean − y)² / r`; empty sets and non-finite arithmetic are refused.
- `assimilate(&Belief, &Observation, &Cx)` / `assimilate_all(&Belief,
  &[Observation], &Cx)` — scalar Kalman fusion. Aggregate fusion uses canonical
  observation-content order, not caller order. Aggregate admission enforces
  `MAX_DENSE_OBSERVATIONS` and the multiplicative
  `MAX_DENSE_UPDATE_CUBIC_WORK` envelope before sorting or updating.
- `assimilate_colored(&Belief, &[Observation], regime_param, lo, hi, &Cx) ->
  AssimilatedPosterior { belief, color, misfit_before, misfit_after }` — a
  read-only, regime-tagged **estimated candidate**. Access is through getters.
- `colored_assimilation_invocation_resources(...)` returns the checked typed
  grant and conservative payload envelope for a colored update.
  `colored_assimilation_invocation_resources_for_shape(...)` derives the same
  envelope from state dimension, observation shapes, and `ExecMode`, allowing a
  parent to seal admission before constructing a validated belief.
  `assimilate_colored_budgeted(..., &Cx, &mut ChildBudget)` reserves that
  envelope before temporary allocation, accounts the whole update through the
  same non-cloneable child, and publishes retained output only on success.
- `assimilate_colored_with_shared_poll_quota(..., &Cx, &mut u32)` is the
  compositional seam for a parent workflow that owns one monotonically
  decreasing poll slice. It rejects a supplied slice above the ambient quota;
  a raw counter does not authenticate provenance or prevent caller reissue.
- `AssimError` — structured invalid-state, dimension, bounds, identity,
  empty-input, noise, covariance, innovation, and non-finite-computation
  refusals. It implements `Display` and `Error`.

## Invariants

- Checked `Belief` and `Observation` values cannot be mutated into malformed
  states through the public API.
- At the external belief-admission boundary, covariance validation is an
  `O(n^3)` diagonal-pivoted Schur-complement certificate after dimensionless
  correlation scaling, with exact zero-variance-row handling. Every 2-by-2
  principal minor is first checked by an exact comparison of the input `f64`
  values as binary-rational products, so a sub-ULP negative determinant cannot
  be rounded onto the correlation boundary. One- and two-dimensional PSD
  inputs, including exact rank-one singular matrices, are thereby decided
  exactly. For active dimension three or greater, every scaled entry and Schur
  update also carries an outward-rounded `fs-ivl::Interval`; admission requires
  every pivot enclosure to be finite and wholly positive. A rounded positive
  point pivot is never authority. Singular PSD boundaries, sufficiently
  ill-conditioned strictly SPD matrices, and unresolved indefinite cases are
  refused with
  `CovarianceCertificationUnresolved`, distinct from a certified indefinite
  principal minor, rather than tolerance-clamped into a PSD claim or falsely
  described as indefinite.
- The scalar Kalman covariance update uses Joseph form
  `(I-KH)P(I-KH)^T + KRK^T`, computes one triangle and mirrors it for bit-exact
  symmetry, then passes the result through the same full validator as an
  externally supplied `Belief`. It does not silently clip eigenvalues or
  correlations. The checked dense implementation is `O(n^3)`.
- In exact arithmetic, fusing valid observations cannot increase component
  variances and the batch posterior cannot increase the weighted measurement
  misfit. Floating results are checked for finiteness, not interval-certified.
- `assimilate_all` and `misfit` canonicalize the complete observation records,
  making results bit-stable across input permutations while retaining duplicate
  readings and therefore their multiplicity.
- Scan noise is instrument noise plus non-negative registration variance; point
  sensors carry no registration term.
- Aggregate APIs reject empty or oversized observation sets. Dense update APIs
  additionally reject `observation_count * state_dimension^3` above the public
  work envelope before canonical sorting, identity materialization, or Joseph
  updates. Instrument and regime-axis identities use `fs-evidence`'s bounded
  leaf grammar; regime bounds must be finite and ordered.
- State and observation dimensions are capped at `MAX_DENSE_STATE_DIM` before a
  linear-size input can trigger quadratic dense allocation. The cap is 256 for
  this synchronous `O(n^3)` v0 core.
- The candidate's `Color::Estimated.estimator` is
  `assimilation-candidate:v4:<64 lowercase hex>`. Its BLAKE3 input uses typed
  length framing and binds the full prior, canonical observation multiset
  (including operator, reading, noise, instrument, and multiplicity), and
  proposed regime. The identity is deterministic, collision-resistant, bounded,
  delimiter-unambiguous, and changes with every bound semantic field.
- Candidate identity v4 additionally binds PSD admission policy
  `exact-2x2-interval-schur:v1` and its numeric policy version, execution mode, logical stream
  identity (all four `StreamKey` fields), every ambient budget field (deadline
  presence/value, poll quota, cost-quota presence/value, and priority), the
  effective poll-quota slice, every component of the checked work plan, and
  poll policy `fixed-stride:v3` with scalar stride 256, record stride 16,
  canonical-comparison byte stride 1,024,
  and identity-hash byte stride 1,024. The work plan itself has no separately
  claimed public “v4” version.
- For state dimension `n`, observation count `m`, canonical record sizes `b_i`,
  `b_max = max(b_i)`, and `L = ceil(log2(m))`, preflight accounts exactly for
  observation validation `m(n+4)`, record materialization `sum(b_i)`, canonical
  merge ordering `2m + mL + mL*b_max`, and each misfit pass
  `m(2n+4)`. An updating call also accounts for the prior clone `n+n^2`, each
  Joseph update `n^3+6n^2+8n+2+(n(n+1)/2)(n+1)`, and each PSD revalidation
  `n^3+6n^2+2`; colored calls add the exact bounded canonical-identity byte
  count. All sums/products are checked before work begins.
- Dense belief validation separately declares `6n+8n^2+n^3` scalar units.
  `misfit` enables one misfit pass without update/hash; plain assimilation
  enables update without misfit/hash; colored assimilation enables two misfit
  passes, update, and hashing. Successful data-dependent paths may consume less
  than the declared fail-closed bound.
- Typed planners retain logical work and abstract cost in distinct dimensions
  with equal numeric values, declare one scientific evaluation, and compute
  poll and byte envelopes before an affine child can spend. Diagonal memory
  covers the retained belief plus active-index, row-descriptor, scaled-cell,
  and pivot-column PSD workspace. Colored assimilation memory covers retained
  output and regime-row payload; canonical records, record descriptors, order
  and merge-scratch indices; old/new belief overlap; Joseph vectors/matrices;
  and PSD revalidation workspace. Output is a separate retained capacity.
- Budgeted entry points charge work, cost, evaluation, every poll, memory, and
  output to one borrowed `ChildBudget`. Scientific failures are latched into
  the parent invocation receipt. Unused capacity returns only when the child
  is consumed by `finish`; this crate cannot clone, increase, or reissue the
  parent authority.
- Candidate dispersion is `+infinity`, the shared explicit no-spread-claim
  sentinel. No API in this crate directly constructs `Color::Validated`.

## Error model

Structured `AssimError`; valid public calls return refusals rather than indexing
panics. Empty/ragged/indefinite/unresolved/non-finite beliefs, malformed observations,
invalid identities and regimes, non-positive or non-finite noise, dimension
mismatches, oversized aggregate count/work requests, degenerate innovations,
and finite-input arithmetic overflow are refused. `WorkPlanOverflow`,
`WorkPlanExceeded`, `PollQuotaExceedsAmbient`, `InvocationBudget`, and
`Cancelled` distinguish planning, accounting, compositional-quota, typed
invocation, and observed-cancellation failures; no partial belief/candidate is
returned. Scientific preflight and domain refusals are latched fail-closed into
the invocation. Allocation failure remains
Rust's process-level behavior inside the admitted public resource envelope.
Preflight checks both retained covariance and temporary interval-certificate
matrix byte shapes before the initial checkpoint.

## Determinism class

Deterministic for a fixed execution manifest: fusion, misfit, candidate
identity, and posterior are pure functions of semantic inputs. Observation
permutation is canonicalized, so it does not change result bits or identity.
Duplicate observations are retained.
Changing the canonical schema or numerical algorithm requires a candidate
identity version/domain bump.

## Cancellation behavior

Synchronous and cancellation-aware. Long-running public APIs perform bounded
shape/work-plan admission before taking an explicit `Cx` checkpoint, then poll
before numerical work and before publication and within bounded scalar, record,
comparison-byte, and hash-byte tiles. Poll-quota exhaustion and
`Cx::checkpoint` cancellation return exact completed/planned logical work and
publish no partial result. The shared-quota seam supports a parent-owned
invocation ledger but cannot authenticate the raw counter it receives.
The budgeted forms instead poll their child authority, which checks an absolute
clock and the originating cancellation gate before consuming each poll. They
do not publish typed output after a deadline, cancellation, resource, or
scientific refusal.

## No-claim boundaries

- v1 is the LINEAR-GAUSSIAN assimilation with linear observation operators;
  full weak-constraint 4D-Var over a nonlinear forward model uses Proposal 1's
  CERTIFIED adjoints (adjoint-certs) and is the fuller deliverable — this crate
  is the Kalman/Gauss-Newton core.
- `Color::Estimated` is deliberate. Consuming calibrated measurements does not
  by itself prove model-form validity in a regime. Promotion to
  `Color::Validated` requires an external admission boundary that verifies
  calibrated dataset provenance, retained validation evidence, and an
  authenticated authority. No generic authenticated validation capability is
  currently owned by this crate, so it exposes no promotion API.
- The semidefinite admission check uses outward-rounded intervals to certify
  the signs of the particular scaled-elimination pivots it admits. This is not
  a complete PSD decision procedure, an eigenvalue enclosure, or a theorem
  about conditioning, and it can return `CovarianceCertificationUnresolved`
  for a mathematically singular PSD matrix, a sufficiently ill-conditioned
  strictly SPD matrix, or an indefinite matrix whose sign it cannot resolve.
  Public admission requires a successful certificate, not merely mathematical
  positive semidefiniteness. The
  Joseph update and other Kalman arithmetic remain floating-point and are not
  interval-certified. No ambiguous or negative pivot is tolerance-clamped into
  an admitted zero pivot.
- The dense v0 state cap is a resource contract, not a scientific limit. Larger
  states require a future sparse or matrix-free implementation with explicit
  memory budgets and tile-boundary cancellation rather than raising this cap.
- The observation operators are SUPPLIED restriction-map rows; deriving them
  from the sheaf's trace maps is fs-geom's. The registration variance accepted
  by scan observations is likewise a caller-supplied, separately calibrated
  variance. The current fs-asbuilt residual RMS is a global fit diagnostic,
  not transform covariance, and MUST NOT be passed as that variance. A typed
  fs-asbuilt covariance or spatial-uncertainty handoff remains future work.
- Ledgering the update onto the per-regime model-form posterior (Proposal 3's
  maps), authenticating calibration receipts, and admitting a validated claim
  are fs-ledger/fs-package integration work; this crate produces the estimated
  candidate and proposed validity domain.
- Logical-work totals and fixed poll strides are accounting/cancellation
  semantics, not claims about instructions, wall-clock time, allocation peaks,
  pause/resume state, deadline/cost enforcement, drain latency, or a
  200-microsecond cancellation bound. G5 is same-process replay for a fixed
  implementation/toolchain manifest, not cross-ISA bit stability.
- Typed planner byte counts are conservative semantic payload envelopes, not
  allocator-overhead or process-RSS measurements. `CostUnits` is abstract and
  is not a wall-time, currency, or energy certificate. A planner describes a
  grant but does not itself admit an invocation; the parent `fs-exec` issuer
  owns admission, deadline/capability/accuracy identities, and the terminal
  receipt.

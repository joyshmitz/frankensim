//! fs-conduction — STEADY heat conduction on tetrahedral complexes
//! (beads `frankensim-extreal-program-f85xj.5.1`, `.5.3`, and `.5.4`).
//! Layer: L3 FLUX.
//!
//! The strong form solved here is
//!
//! ```text
//!   −∇·(k(T, x) ∇T) = f            in Ω
//!                 T = T_D          on Γ_D
//!         (−k∇T)·n  = q_n          on Γ_N
//!         (−k∇T)·n  = h (T − T_ref) on Γ_R
//! ```
//!
//! with `k` a symmetric positive-definite conductivity TENSOR that may
//! depend on temperature, `f` a volumetric source in W/m³, `q_n` the
//! prescribed OUTWARD heat flux in W/m² (positive = leaving Ω), and
//! `h`/`T_ref` the convective transfer coefficient (W/(m²·K)) and its
//! declared reference temperature (K).
//!
//! Discretization: continuous P₁ Lagrange (the FEEC 0-form / Whitney
//! vertex-hat space on `fs-feec`'s tet complexes). Element geometry —
//! signed volumes and the constant barycentric gradients ∇λ_a — comes
//! from [`fs_feec::element_geometry`]; nothing here re-derives it.
//! Assembly stages triplets into `fs-sparse`'s [`fs_sparse::Coo`], whose
//! canonicalization makes the matrix a pure function of the staged
//! multiset, so tile interleaving cannot move a bit.
//!
//! What travels WITH a solve: the `fs-matdb` property-usage receipts
//! that produced every conductivity number (see [`material`]), the typed
//! residual claim of every linear solve RE-MEASURED as a Euclidean
//! residual by this crate (see [`solve::LinearSolveEvidence`]), and an
//! energy-balance closure over the assembled operator.
//!
//! # No-claim boundaries (short form; `CONTRACT.md` is authoritative)
//!
//! - STEADY ONLY. There is no time derivative, no heat capacity, and no
//!   transient staging in this crate.
//! - Surface radiation supports a card-backed linearized Robin model and
//!   deterministic gray-diffuse enclosure exchange over an admitted
//!   view-factor matrix. This crate does not generate view factors, run QMC,
//!   model participating media, or propagate a nonlinear uncertainty bound.
//! - NO convection PHYSICS. The Robin row is a convective boundary *coupling*:
//!   `h` is an input, never a computed correlation.
//! - Thermal contact supports matching P1 traces on exact duplicated
//!   coordinates. Nonmatching/mortar contact, pressure-dependent closure,
//!   and implicit perfect contact are outside this rung.
//! - Observed convergence orders are OBSERVED. The G1 battery fits and
//!   gates slopes on the fixture ladders it runs; it is not a proof of
//!   the order for arbitrary meshes, coefficients, or data.
//! - A converged residual is not an error bound. This crate reports
//!   residuals and an energy-balance closure; it does not ship a
//!   certified bound on `‖T − T_h‖`.

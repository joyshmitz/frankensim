//! Deterministic mesh fixtures for the conduction batteries.
//!
//! Everything here is built from ONE primitive: a structured `nx × ny ×
//! nz` index grid, each cell split into the 6 Kuhn/Freudenthal
//! tetrahedra, with vertex POSITIONS supplied by a caller mapping from
//! the index grid. Because the diagonals are chosen by index order (not
//! geometry), the subdivision stays conforming under any injective,
//! orientation-preserving mapping — which is how the same routine
//! produces the unit cube, a rectangular fin, a curved annular sector,
//! and a pole-free spherical-shell patch.
//!
//! Generation is pure combinatorics plus the caller's mapping: no RNG,
//! no floating-point branching, identical across runs. Trigonometry in
//! [`annulus_sector`] routes through `fs_math::det`, so even the curved
//! fixture is bit-identical across ISAs.

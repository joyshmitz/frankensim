//! fs-frame — Flagship 2 (plan §15.2, bead mye.3): the SEISMIC-MINIMAL
//! building frame, smoke tier. Layer: L6 HELM.
//!
//! Five stages, each riding a crate that already carries its own
//! battery: LAYOUT (fs-truss ground structure + PDHG diagnostics + outward
//! optimum certificate),
//! SIZING (Euler floors, catalog
//! up-snapping, code rows), TIME HISTORY (fiber-hinge story model —
//! Mander concrete + Menegotto–Pinto steel through fs-solid sections —
//! under fs-scenario Kanai–Tajimi ensembles, Newmark average
//! acceleration), FRAGILITY (anytime-valid e-stopped exceedance
//! probability via fs-eproc confidence sequences + an fs-uq MLMC
//! report), and CVaR MASS MINIMIZATION (Rockafellar–Uryasev over the
//! section scale, then catalog snap with independent re-check).
//!
//! SMOKE TIER, honestly: one story, two fiber-hinge columns, synthetic
//! motions only. The full-resolution lanes (distributed-plasticity
//! frames, recorded-motion suites, million-member ground structures,
//! variational integrators) are recorded successors in the CONTRACT —
//! named, not pretended.

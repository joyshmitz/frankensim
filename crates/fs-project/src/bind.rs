//! Validate-time resolution of material and interface card bindings
//! (bead f85xj.6.4): every declared region resolves to a matdb
//! `MaterialCard` and every declared interface to an
//! `InterfaceSystemCard`, with the envelope-vs-validity check performed
//! BEFORE any solve — the product's first line of defense against silent
//! extrapolation.
//!
//! The resolver never invents authority. Every property value comes out
//! of `fs-matdb`'s receipted query path (so refusals are matdb's own
//! typed refusals mapped to project violations with fixes), every query
//! receipt is retained for the run ledger, `Unstated` uncertainty is
//! surfaced up front as an advisory (it caps downstream evidence at
//! Estimated), and a card with coexisting conflicting claims resolves
//! only through the explicit `claim` pin recorded in the project file —
//! there is no auto-pick path.
//!
//! Coverage logic: a claim's `ValidityDomain` bounds are per-axis
//! intervals, so a domain that contains both endpoints of the admitted
//! range contains the whole range. The resolver therefore queries each
//! property at BOTH endpoints and additionally requires the SAME claim
//! to be selected at both — two different claims covering one endpoint
//! each would leave the interior ambiguous or stitched, which is a
//! refusal, not a resolution.

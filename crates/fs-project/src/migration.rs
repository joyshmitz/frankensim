//! Version-bump machinery for the `.fsim` envelope, proven before it is ever
//! needed: readers admit exactly [`crate::FSIM_VERSION`], and any older
//! envelope must pass through [`migrate_envelope`], which re-emits canonical
//! bytes under the current version and binds both byte strings into a
//! [`ProjectMigrationReceipt`]. There is no implicit migration path.
//!
//! Version 1 is the first real schema version, so the only registered rule is
//! the synthetic proof rule from version 0: a version-0 envelope differing
//! from version 1 solely in its declared version. It exists to prove the
//! receipt machinery end to end (bead f85xj.6.1's acceptance criterion), and
//! it says so in its name.

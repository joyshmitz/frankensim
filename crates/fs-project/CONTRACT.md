# CONTRACT: fs-project

The versioned `.fsim` project schema (bead f85xj.6.1): the user-facing
contract for the ratified thermal-design-assurance vertical
(`frankensim-vertical-ratification-v1`). One semantic model, two spellings,
canonical bytes, typed violations, receipted defaults, and explicit migration
receipts. The `bind` module (bead f85xj.6.4) adds validate-time resolution of
material/interface bindings against matdb cards: envelope-vs-domain refusal,
surfaced uncertainty, retained usage receipts, and pin-only resolution of
conflicting claims.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L6 (HELM). Depends on `fs-ir` (AST + both concrete syntaxes),
`fs-scenario` (entity identities, `Violation`), `fs-matdb` (cards, receipted
queries), `fs-qty`, `fs-blake3`. This crate persists project intent and
resolves its card bindings; it runs no solves and admits no scenarios
itself.

## Public types and semantics

- `ProjectSpec` carries every section of the cooling vertical's contract:
  `Metadata` (name, created, context of use, intended decision), the Five
  Explicits (`Versions`, `Seeds`, `Budgets`, capabilities list,
  `UnitsDoctrine`), `GeometryArtifact` references (imported quarantine-receipt
  ids — geometry never lives inline), `EntityDecl`
  assembly/part/region/interface declarations with persistent identities,
  `MaterialBinding` matdb card refs (state, admitted temperature range,
  source, optional `claim` pin), `InterfaceCardBinding` TIM/contact card refs
  (optional `claim` pin), `PowerDissipation`
  rows, `Cooling` (fans/vents/leakage; declared-empty lists are facts,
  omission is a violation), `Envelope`, `ThermalLimit` requirements with
  margins, `SolverSettings`, and `OutputRequest`s. Sections are `Option`s so
  recognition stays lenient and validation can name every omission at once.
- `ProjectSpec::validate() -> Vec<Violation>` (the fs-scenario
  code/what/fix triple): empty output is the definition of admissible. Every
  mandatory section omission has a stable `project-*-missing` code; empty
  load-bearing collections, dimension mismatches (checked against the six-base
  SI vectors in `spec::dims`), inverted ranges, malformed card hashes, duty
  range, unknown entity references, duplicate names, and out-of-order parents
  all carry named codes with fix hints.
- Entity identities: `resolve_entities` recomputes `fs_scenario::EntityId`s
  from the declarations (parents before children; interfaces reference two
  regions under an assembly). An optional `:id` pin is verified against the
  recomputation and drift is `project-entity-id-mismatch` — a pin proves
  byte-equal derivation inputs, never physical sameness. Display names are
  outside identity, exactly as in fs-scenario.
- Wire: `lower`/`recognize` map `ProjectSpec` to and from the `fs_ir::Node`
  envelope `(fsim-project :version 1 ...)`. `print_sexpr`/`parse_sexpr` and
  `print_json`/`parse_json` are the two spellings; `parse_sexpr_lenient`
  accepts noncanonical bytes and omitted defaultable fields, issuing a
  `CanonicalizationReceipt` (both hashes, `verifies()`) and `DefaultReceipt`s.
  The strict parsers refuse noncanonical input (`fsim-non-canonical`, first
  difference position) and applied defaults (`fsim-default-in-strict-mode`).
- Canonical bytes are the checked s-expression render; `canonical_hash`
  hashes them under `org.frankensim.fs-project.canonical.v1`. The JSON
  spelling parses to the same AST, so both spellings reach one hash.
- `FSIM_VERSION = 1`. Readers refuse other versions
  (`fsim-unsupported-version`); `migrate_envelope` is the only path from an
  older envelope, applies a registered `MigrationRule`, and returns a
  `ProjectMigrationReceipt` (old/new hashes + rule, `verifies()`). The only
  registered rule is the synthetic version-0 proof rule, named as such.
- The ONE defaultable field is power-row `duty` (`1.0`, continuous
  dissipation is the conservative assumption); everything else is mandatory,
  and the default is always receipted.
- `bind::resolve_bindings(&ProjectSpec, &CardLibrary, &BindingRequirements)
  -> MaterialResolution` (bead f85xj.6.4): every declared region must bind
  exactly one `fs_matdb::MaterialCard` (manufactured state spelled exactly as
  the card's `MaterialStateId`) and every declared interface exactly one
  `InterfaceSystemCard`. Per required property, the resolver queries matdb at
  BOTH endpoints of the binding's admitted range (validity boxes are per-axis
  intervals, so endpoint containment implies range containment) and requires
  the SAME claim selected at both. Every value arrives as matdb
  `Evidence` + `PropertyUsageReceipt`; receipts are retained
  (`RetainedReceipt`: receipt, canonical bytes, content hash, context) for
  ledger retention and later `verify_receipt` replay. `render_table()` is the
  deterministic region -> card -> property -> uncertainty -> receipts log.
  `BindingRequirements::thermal_steady_v1()` pins the cooling vertical's
  property set (`thermal-conductivity`,
  `area-specific-thermal-contact-resistance`, axis `T`), drift-tested against
  `fs-conduction`'s constants.
- Conflicting-claims doctrine: when a card carries coexisting conflicting
  claims, resolution refuses (`project-binding-claims-conflict`, listing every
  candidate hash) unless the project file records an explicit `:claim <hex>`
  pin, which resolves through matdb's receipted pinned-claim query. There is
  no auto-pick path, and `PreferObservationBacked` is deliberately never used
  by the resolver. A pin never bypasses validity.
- The per-region required range is the envelope's ambient range with its
  ceiling raised to every declared thermal limit on that region (data must be
  valid up to the limit being judged); an interface must be covered wherever
  either side region can operate. The binding's admitted range must cover the
  required range (`project-material-envelope-uncovered`), and the card's
  claims must cover the admitted range (`project-binding-domain-uncovered` —
  the extrapolation refusal, surfaced at validate time).
- Uncertainty surfacing: `Unstated` uncertainty is an `Advisory`
  (`binding-uncertainty-unstated`) up front, never a refusal and never
  laundered — it caps downstream evidence at Estimated and the table says so.

## Invariants

- Parse-render-parse is byte-idempotent for canonical documents in both
  spellings, and `print_sexpr` is deterministic.
- The strict parsers accept exactly the canonical bytes; the lenient parser
  never accepts silently (receipt or violation for every relaxation).
- Unknown sections and unknown keywords are refused by name
  (`project-unknown-field`), so typos cannot silently drop intent.
- Recognition never panics on malformed clause shapes; it degrades to named
  violations with placeholder values that validation then rejects.
- `Violation.fix` is non-empty for every emitted code (tested via the broken
  corpus).

## Error model

Two tiers, exactly as in fs-scenario/fs-ir: wire-layer refusals are
`ProjectError { code, detail, hint }` (syntax, non-project shape, unsupported
version, non-canonical bytes, strict-mode defaults, quantity spelling,
migration refusals); semantic findings are `Violation` triples collected by
`validate()`/`DecodedProject::findings()`. Binding resolution reports the
same triples (`project-binding-*` / `project-material-*` /
`project-interface-*` codes, each with an actionable fix; matdb's own
refusal text travels in `what`) plus non-refusing `Advisory` rows; it is
total over garbage input, naming preconditions instead of panicking.
Internal `expect` is limited to infallible writes to `String`.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: pure functions of the input bytes/spec; canonical
rendering has one spelling; hashing is domain-separated BLAKE3 over exact
bytes. No clocks, no RNG, no environment reads.

## Cancellation behavior

None. Documents are bounded project descriptions; a validation budget/plan
triad (fs-scenario style) is deliberately deferred until real projects show
the loader can be large, and is named future work rather than pretended.

## Unsafe boundary

None. Workspace `deny(unsafe_code)` lint applies.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/bind.rs` (f85xj.6.4): the reference project binds fully — three
resolved bindings, six retained receipts, each replayed via
`verify_receipt` and byte-decoded via `from_bytes_verified`, with the full
chain logged in the table; envelope-outside-card-domain refuses at validate;
an admitted range narrower than the envelope refuses with both ranges named;
Unstated uncertainty warns without refusing; conflicting claims refuse
without a pin (no resolved row exists — auto-pick impossible) and resolve to
exactly the pinned claim with the `pinned-claim` receipt policy; pin
refusals (unknown, out-of-domain, malformed) are typed; a range stitched
from two claims refuses; card-unknown, state-mismatch, non-region target,
duplicate, unbound-region/interface, wrong-dims, and missing-property each
carry their named code with a fix; missing sections name the precondition;
and the property constants drift-test against `fs-conduction`.

`tests/project.rs`: the reference cooling project renders, parses strictly,
is admissible, and hash-stable; canonical bytes are identical across both
spellings; parse-render-parse idempotence across variants (empty cooling
lists, identity pins); all sixteen mandatory-section omissions surface their
named violations; unknown section and keyword refusal; the receipted duty
default with canonicalization receipt (and strict-mode refusal of the same
bytes); noncanonical whitespace refusal/receipt; the synthetic v0 migration
round trip with verifying receipt plus refusal of no-op and unknown-version
migrations; entity identity pins accepting the recomputed token and refusing
a stale one; and the broken-project corpus (14 rows) logging every violation
with its fix as the error-message quality bar.

## No-claim boundaries

- An admissible `.fsim` document proves the project is well-formed and
  internally consistent. It does NOT prove the referenced geometry artifacts,
  matdb cards, or capabilities exist, are compatible, or are validated —
  geometry existence checks belong to the import/admission path (bead .6.3)
  and the capability registry, not this schema. Card existence and coverage
  ARE checked by `bind::resolve_bindings`, but only against the
  caller-supplied `CardLibrary`: the library keys cards by their own content
  hashes (a key cannot lie about its card), while WHO supplied the collection
  is the caller's trust channel — resolution proves binding coverage, never
  card authenticity or scientific truth of the underlying claims.
- Binding resolution is temperature-axis-only in v1: cards whose claims
  depend on further validity axes refuse (`project-binding-axis`) rather
  than being partially resolved. The required ceiling uses DECLARED thermal
  limits, not solved temperatures — a solve exceeding its limit fails its
  requirement; the resolver only guarantees the material data covers the
  range over which that judgment is made. The declared `source` channel on a
  binding is recorded into the table, not authenticated against claim
  provenance.
- A pinned-claim receipt proves the pin resolves and evaluates identically
  on replay; WHO pinned it is proven by the project file's canonical bytes
  (the pin is part of the hashed document), so a verifier must cross-check
  `receipt.selected` against the project's pin, exactly as matdb's CONTRACT
  states.
- The optional `claim` pin was added to version 1 before the schema freeze
  (.16.5): version 1 is still pre-freeze (see below), absence of the field
  is the canonical spelling of "no pin", and pre-pin documents are
  byte-identical under the extended grammar.
- Entity identity pins prove byte-equal derivation inputs at declaration
  time; unequal pins prove nothing about physical sameness (re-exports change
  bytes), which is why drift is a violation to adjudicate, not an automatic
  rebind.
- The schema does not persist fs-scenario's full `EntityCatalog`/
  `BindingTable` receipts (rebind chains, correspondences, evidence tiers);
  the fs-scenario CONTRACT's delegation of catalog+binding persistence to
  this crate is met for declarations and will extend to receipt chains when
  the import path (.6.3) produces them.
- `source_hash` on geometry artifacts reproduces `fs_io::ImportReceipt`'s
  current 64-bit FNV field: deterministic correlation, not
  collision-resistant authentication; the HELM-side BLAKE3-class upgrade is
  tracked upstream.
- The schema freeze (e16, bead .16.5) has NOT happened: version 1 is the
  first implemented version, not yet a frozen public promise. The migration
  machinery exists so the freeze can be honest when it lands.
- Validation is structural and dimensional; it makes no physics claim (a
  well-formed project can still describe an unsolvable or nonsensical study).

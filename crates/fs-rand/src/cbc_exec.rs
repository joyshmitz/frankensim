//! Tiled, cancellable, resumable execution of exact component-by-component
//! lattice construction (bead 6ys.20, execution tranche over the admission
//! tranche in [`crate::cbc`]).
//!
//! The executor performs byte-identically the same arithmetic in the same
//! logical order as [`crate::qmc::Lattice::cbc`] — points ascending within a
//! candidate, candidates ascending within a prefix, exact lowest-candidate
//! tie resolution — so the chosen generator vector is invariant under tile
//! shape and pause/resume splits by construction, not by averaging. Tiling
//! changes only where cancellation and allowance checks may observe the
//! computation, never the bytes it produces.
//!
//! Work accounting debits the SAME conservative per-unit schedule the
//! admission estimate integrates (limb charges at the admitted widths,
//! scalar charges at the declared per-primitive constants), so the running
//! total is monotone, tile-shape independent, and bounded by the admitted
//! `work_units` for every admitted problem. A run-scoped allowance slices
//! that admitted total across `run` calls: exhaustion finalizes at a tile
//! boundary with a replayable state and a named boundary class.
//!
//! Cancellation is request → drain → finalize: the poll is observed at tile
//! boundaries only, the current tile always completes, and the returned
//! state never contains a half-committed generator component (`prefix()`
//! only ever grows by whole chosen components).
//!
//! NO-CLAIM: this tranche does not yet serialize state for cross-process
//! pause/migrate/fork (the state lives in the executor value) or parallelize
//! candidate scoring. `korobov_error_sq` stays a diagnostic f64 owned by
//! [`crate::qmc::Lattice`].

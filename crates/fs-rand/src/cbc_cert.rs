//! Per-prefix minimality certificates for exact component-by-component
//! lattice construction, with an independent checker (bead 6ys.20,
//! certificate tranche).
//!
//! A [`CbcPrefixCertificate`] binds, for one scanned component: the exact
//! reduction root (the committed prefix itself — the products a scan scored
//! against are a pure function of `(n, prefix)`, so declaring the prefix
//! declares them exactly, with no hash indirection), the chosen candidate,
//! the exact winning numerator, the exact runner-up numerator or its
//! absence, the winning equality class, the tie rule, the admissible-set
//! rule, and the common-denominator derivation the numerators drop.
//!
//! The checker is INDEPENDENT — it recomputes with its own arithmetic from
//! the declared inputs and never trusts executor state — and has two
//! honestly named modes:
//!
//! - [`verify_consistency`] recomputes the winning, tie-class, and
//!   runner-up scores from the declared prefix in `O(n · |claims|)` exact
//!   work: cheap, but it proves the DECLARED candidates score as claimed,
//!   not that no other candidate scores lower.
//! - [`audit_minimality`] rescans every admissible candidate at the
//!   declared prefix (`O(n²)` exact work per certificate): the full
//!   minimality proof by exhaustion.
//! - [`verify_consistency_admitted`] and [`audit_minimality_admitted`] first
//!   require a current certified CBC admission whose problem covers the
//!   declared prefix, then bound every hostile vector length before invoking
//!   the corresponding checker.
//!
//! NO-CLAIM: the legacy checker entry points do not require admission. A
//! receipt supplied to an admitted checker bounds one call's problem shape and
//! hostile vector lengths, but it is not a consumable meter and does not claim
//! checker debit equality with the executor schedule. A compact sub-quadratic
//! minimality proof (branch-and-bound / sheaf-glued sections) is the bead's [M]
//! ratchet, not this tranche; the first component's unit-residue-permutation
//! theorem certificate is the [F] ratchet, so certificates here start at the
//! first SCANNED component. Certificates are plain data with no fs-blake3
//! identity minting; identity governance for durable certificate stores
//! belongs to consumers.

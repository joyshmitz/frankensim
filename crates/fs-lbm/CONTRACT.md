# CONTRACT: fs-lbm

Lattice Boltzmann core with a D2Q9 BGK path, a tile-major D3Q19 BGK/Guo path,
link-wise D3Q19 wall/open-boundary topology, the lattice-scaling assistant,
and dense-grid extension scaffolding for vector forcing, local rheology,
thermal double-population fixtures, and a free-surface mass-ledger prototype.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L3 (FLUX). Depends on `fs-evidence` (the `Color` for the Evidence-typed
scaling plan) and deterministic `fs-math` primitives. Pure, deterministic
(fixed tile/cell/link order).

## Public types and semantics

- D2Q9 constants: `Q` (9), `CS2` (`1/3`), `MACH_LIMIT` (`0.3`).
- `equilibrium(rho, ux, uy) -> [f64; 9]` — the D2Q9 equilibrium distribution
  (recovers `Σf = ρ`, `Σeᵢfᵢ = ρu`).
- `Lbm::channel(nx, ny, tau, gx)` — a body-force-driven channel (periodic x,
  bounce-back y-walls). `step`/`run` (collide + Guo forcing + stream +
  bounce-back); `density`, `velocity` (Guo-corrected), `total_mass`,
  `viscosity` (`ν = (τ−½)/3`), `x_velocity_profile`.
- `core2::Grid` / re-exported `Grid` — a general dense D2Q9 grid with cell
  flags, vector gravity, per-cell relaxation time, per-cell external force,
  periodicity flags, deterministic collide/stream steps, and gas/wall
  boundary bounce handling for the plain non-free-surface step.
- `rheology::Rheology`, `rheology::update_tau`, and
  `rheology::channel_flow` — local apparent-viscosity laws and explicit
  τ updates with floor/cap counts for cells outside the representable
  relaxation window.
- `thermal::ThermalLbm` and `thermal::gbeta_for_rayleigh` — D2Q9 flow plus
  D2Q5 temperature populations for Rayleigh-Bénard-style onset fixtures with
  fixed-temperature wall rows.
- `freesurface::FreeSurface`, `ContactModel`, `dam_break`, and `surge_front`
  — dense-grid VOF-style mass tracking with interface/gas/fluid conversion
  bookkeeping, conservative carry redistribution, contact-model bracketing,
  and qualitative dam-break / jet-fragment fixtures.
- `d3q19::{Duct, equilibrium3, duct_analytic}` — the frozen D3Q19 BGK + Guo
  body-force core on aligned 4x4x4 SoA tiles, with stationary halfway
  bounce-back x/y walls and periodic z for the rectangular-duct fixture.
- `d3q19::{CollisionModel3, collide_cell3, CollisionError3}` — the shared
  checked per-cell collision authority used by both D3Q19 grids. `Bgk { tau }`
  retains each frozen force-projection arithmetic path. The unforced
  `CentralMoment` reference rung relaxes a full-rank centered D3Q19 monomial
  basis with independent second/higher-order rates. `ReducedCumulant` applies
  the nonlinear `C220`/`C202`/`C022` corrections to the three independent
  fourth-order rows represented by that basis. All paths reject invalid
  parameters or state before publication.
- `D3Q19_MOMENT_COLLISION_SEMANTICS_VERSION` — independent version for the
  optional moment-space basis, rate grouping, `mul_add` chains, cumulant
  projection, and deterministic back-transform. It does not refreeze the
  established BGK grid golden.
- `Face3`, `FaceBoundary3`, and `BoundarySpec3` — six-face axis-aligned
  boundary declarations: paired periodic faces, tangential moving/stationary
  halfway walls, regularized velocity faces, and isothermal pressure/density
  faces. Open faces currently require zero body force.
- `LinkMaskTile3` and `BoundaryLink3` — aligned per-tile D3Q19 effective-wall
  masks and canonical `(tile, lane, direction)` enumeration. Separate open
  masks distinguish populations reconstructed after streaming.
- `BoundaryGrid3` — tile-major D3Q19 grid whose compiled masks drive the
  runtime pull stencil. The legacy `new(..., tau, ...)` constructor remains
  BGK, while `with_collision_model` selects an explicit checked model for the
  whole grid. `voxelize_sdf` samples a scalar field at cell centers, commits
  solid occupancy/masks atomically, and then locks topology. Solid and planar
  walls use link-wise halfway bounce-back. Moving walls add the standard
  `2 w_i rho (c_i dot u_wall) / c_s^2` incoming-link correction.
  Velocity/pressure face-interior cells use second-order Hermite regularized
  non-equilibrium-stress reconstruction from the first interior cell.
- `plan_scaling(reynolds, char_length_lu, u_lattice) -> ScalingPlan { tau,
  viscosity, u_lattice, mach, tau_margin, stable }` — the lattice-scaling
  assistant. `ScalingPlan::color()` (verified when comfortably stable, else
  estimated). Panics on non-positive Reynolds / length.
- `poiseuille_analytic(gx, viscosity, ny, y)` — the analytic reference profile.

## Invariants

- The equilibrium recovers its density + momentum moments exactly.
- Unforced shared-cell collision preserves density and all three momentum
  components to roundoff; both grid implementations delegate collision to this
  one authority path.
- Equal-rate central-moment collision reduces to BGK within deterministic
  transform/solve roundoff. Split higher-order relaxation changes
  nonequilibrium modes without relaxing degree-zero/one invariants.
- Reduced-cumulant collision preserves degree-zero/one invariants, fixes the
  discrete equilibrium to solve roundoff, and is covariant under Cartesian
  axis permutation when rates are equal within each represented order. Its
  nonlinear fourth-order relaxation does not reduce to BGK at equal rates.
- MASS is conserved by a closed-domain step (collision, forcing, streaming,
  and bounce-back all conserve mass). Prescribed velocity/pressure faces are
  open-system flux boundaries and do not claim global mass conservation.
- Steady Poiseuille channel flow matches the analytic parabola to a few percent
  (halfway bounce-back resolves the quadratic profile).
- `plan_scaling` derives `τ = 3ν + ½`, flags `stable` iff `τ > ½` AND
  `Mach < MACH_LIMIT`.
- General dense-grid constructors reject zero dimensions and nonphysical
  relaxation times before arithmetic can produce NaNs.
- Gas cells do not act as fluid population sources in the plain dense-grid
  stream step; absent gas-side populations bounce at the fluid boundary until
  explicit free-surface bookkeeping lands.
- Rheology laws reject non-finite or non-positive physical parameters, and
  every update reports floor/cap counts when viscosity leaves the representable
  τ window.
- Thermal wall populations encode the declared wall temperatures, so the
  public `temperature` query is consistent on wall and fluid rows.
- Free-surface steps conserve the tracked ledger mass (fluid `Σf` plus
  interface mass plus carry) to the test tolerance, and gas/interface/fluid
  conversions are counted rather than hidden.
- D3Q19 wall and open masks are disjoint and compiled in tile/lane/direction
  order. Where an open face meets a wall, directions crossing both faces are
  stationary wall-owned while pure open-face directions are reconstructed;
  where moving exterior walls disagree at an edge/corner, the whole cell is
  stationary so diagonal corrections cannot create an unpaired mass source.
- Voxelized topology is initialization-only and two-phase: failed/non-finite,
  all-solid, or open-neighbor-invalid proposals leave occupancy and masks
  unchanged. A committed topology cannot be silently changed after
  perturbation or stepping.
- Stationary planar and voxel bounce-back conserve mass to roundoff. Tangential
  moving-wall corrections sum to zero over the represented link set.
- On face-interior cells, regularized velocity/pressure reconstruction
  preserves the declared zeroth and first moments and copies the independently
  measured non-equilibrium second moment from the first interior cell. Mixed
  wall/open rim cells preserve their per-link wall ownership instead of
  claiming exact target moments.

## Error model

Most operations are total over physically admissible inputs. Constructors and
parameter helpers panic on nonsensical requests: zero dimensions, non-finite
forces/relaxation times, non-positive viscosities/rheology indices, non-positive
Rayleigh height, or non-positive Reynolds/length in the scaling assistant.
D3Q19 boundary construction additionally rejects non-4-multiple dimensions,
tile-count overflow, invalid collision parameters, moment-space collision with
nonzero force, unpaired periodic faces, non-tangential/non-finite or
outside-low-Mach wall velocities, non-finite or outside-low-Mach inlet
velocities, non-positive pressure density, open faces on more than one axis,
and body force combined with the current regularized open-face closure.
Voxelization rejects non-finite samples, an all-solid domain, an obstructed
first-interior open-face layer, and topology mutation after initialization.
Boundary-grid perturbation rejects non-finite amplitudes or magnitudes at least
one before changing populations or locking topology.
`collide_cell3` returns typed errors rather than publishing non-finite or
non-positive cell states. Both moment-space rungs additionally refuse rates
outside `(0, 2)`, nonzero body forcing, or a numerically rank-deficient moment
transform.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: fixed cell iteration order for D2Q9 and fixed
tile/lane/direction plus face/z/y/x reconstruction order for D3Q19; no RNG.

## Cancellation behavior

None here (a step is synchronous); polling at tile boundaries under `Cx` is the
production kernel's concern.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via the workspace lint.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/lbm.rs` covers the v0 core: equilibrium moments; mass conservation;
Poiseuille flow matches the analytic parabola (symmetric, centered); the
scaling assistant derives τ + flags stability + colors the plan; it rejects a
high-Mach plan and nonsense inputs; determinism.

`tests/extensions.rs` covers the current extension scaffolding: power-law and
Newtonian-limit channel profiles, Carreau plateaus, Rayleigh-Bénard onset
bracketing and Nusselt heat transport, gas-neighbor streaming behavior, thermal
wall-temperature queries, invalid-parameter rejection, free-surface mass-ledger
conservation, qualitative dam-break front advance, rotation equivariance,
contact-model bracketing, and qualitative jet fragmentation.

`tests/extensions.rs` (tfz.19): lbm-101 power-law/Carreau profiles vs
analytic (0.12% with τ floor+cap ledger); lbm-102 Rayleigh–Bénard onset
bracket (decay Ra=1200 / growth Ra=2500, Nu>1); lbm-104 STRICT free-
surface mass ledger (5e-14 over 600 dam-break steps, conversions
counted); lbm-105 dam-break front envelope (coarse honesty band);
lbm-106 G3 rotation equivariance (3e-14); lbm-107 contact-model
bracket band + Plateau–Rayleigh jet fragmentation with strict ledger;
lbm-108 level-jump refinement (Poiseuille through the interface +
shear-wave decay-rate transmission, first-order labels).

`tests/d3q19_battery.rs` covers the frozen D3Q19 core: exact integer lattice
moments/opposites, equilibrium moments, mass conservation, analytic
rectangular-duct flow, replay determinism, the registered core golden, shared
kernel bit-equivalence, BGK/central-moment equal-rate equivalence, split-rate
conservation, reduced-cumulant equilibrium/nonlinearity/axis-covariance laws,
and fail-closed inputs.

`tests/d3q19_boundaries.rs` (bead 40p2) covers all six hand-enumerated planar
link masks, aligned deterministic mask ordering, the exact 18 links around one
voxel, atomic immutable SDF topology and rejection paths, axis-generic
regularized face density/velocity plus independent inlet/outlet stress
reconstruction, grid-level collision selection and equal-rate BGK/central
agreement, split-rate cumulant conservation, open/wall and moving/open rim
ownership, stationary planar and voxel mass conservation, exact one-step
moving-lid momentum oracles, qualitative primary cavity circulation,
pressure-driven Poiseuille shape, and a boundary replay-hash candidate. Ignored
release fixtures carry the full 10,000-step leak and 32x32 full-rim 3%
pressure-Poiseuille gates.

## No-claim boundaries

- D3Q19 grids remain BGK + Guo on a dense set of aligned SoA tiles. The
  selectable central-moment and `ReducedCumulant` cell operators are
  deterministic `O(Q^3)` correctness references: they are unforced and have no
  performance or high-Re stability claim. D3Q27, sparse active-tile
  storage/sweeps, a production cumulant collision, momentum-exchange
  drag/lift, and bandwidth roofline / fs-tilelang kernels remain staged. Geier
  et al.'s primary derivation (doi:10.1016/j.camwa.2015.05.001) explicitly
  restricts itself to D3Q27 after identifying non-refining D3Q19 anisotropy.
  `ReducedCumulant` therefore implements only the general cumulant definitions
  for the independent D3Q19 `C220`/`C202`/`C022` projection; it is not a
  "Geier D3Q19" operator and cannot borrow the paper's high-Re evidence.
- SDF voxelization is midpoint classification followed by stair-step halfway
  bounce-back. It is second-order for the represented flat, lattice-aligned
  halfway wall, not a second-order certificate against the original continuous
  curved SDF. Interpolated Bouzidi-type curved boundaries remain staged.
- The face-generic regularized closure was selected instead of six
  face-specialized Zou-He tables because its Hermite stress projection has an
  independent second-moment oracle and preserves arbitrary tangential target
  components under one implementation. This is not evidence that a correct
  Zou-He/Hecht-Harting implementation is unstable. The current closure is a
  low-Mach fixture, not a high-Re characteristic/non-reflecting boundary; it
  accepts only constant per-face targets and refuses simultaneous Guo force.
- Open/wall intersections use an explicit per-link mixed policy: wall-crossing
  links bounce stationary, pure open-normal links are regularized, and links
  crossing both faces are wall-owned. This is not a geometric corner
  reconstruction, and exact target moments are claimed only on face-interior
  cells. Moving-wall cavity evidence is qualitative until the separate G2
  benchmark bead lands.
- Solid topology is static after initialization. Moving/deforming SDF
  boundaries require a future explicit population initialization, mass delta,
  and topology-transition receipt rather than reusing `voxelize_sdf`.
- Interface and gas flags exist so the plain core can share the future data
  model, but free-surface mass/VOF bookkeeping is not implemented in
  `Grid::step`; gas-side pulls currently bounce rather than reconstructing
  missing free-surface populations.
- Thermal and rheology fixtures are dense-grid correctness scaffolding, not
  validated LES, cumulant, sparse-tile, or production multiphase solvers.
- The free-surface implementation is a dense prototype with ledger and
  metamorphic gates. It does not yet claim quantitative dam-break agreement,
  contact-angle calibration, production wetting physics, or validated
  surface-tension breakup rates.
- The scaling assistant covers the `τ`/`ν`/`Mach` core; consuming fs-regime's
  dimensionless groups and emitting a full `dx`/`dt` unit conversion with
  Evidence provenance is the fuller deliverable.
- Grid refinement is the TWO-LEVEL 1:2 channel coupling with Dupuis–Chopard
  non-equilibrium rescaling and a FIRST-ORDER interface handoff: measured
  2.5% steady Poiseuille deviation at the level jump and 5.6% extra shear-
  wave decay rate — honesty-labeled in lbm-108; the post-collision
  (Filippova–Hänel-style) second-order transfer, general octree topologies,
  and dwr-adaptivity-driven refinement signals are recorded successors.
- Contact-line physics is MODEL-BRACKETED (neutral vs wetting fill ghosts,
  lbm-107 reports the sensitivity band), never pretended-certain — the
  §15.3 caveat is a design decision here, not an omission.
- ADJOINT HONESTY (plan §8.7 [M]): free-surface LBM adjoints are NOT
  promised — cell-conversion events make the map non-differentiable;
  gradients for free-surface objectives go through surrogate or
  gradient-free lanes. The model card is this paragraph.
- Pouring scenarios: tilt schedules enter as the rotating gravity vector
  (lbm-106 pins 90-degree equivariance at 3e-14); full fs-scenario moving-
  frame integration and Plateau–Rayleigh breakup SCORING (beyond the
  qualitative fragment gate) are staged with the vessel flagship.

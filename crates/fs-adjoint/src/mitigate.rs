//! NON-DIFFERENTIABLE MESHING MITIGATIONS (addendum Proposal 1, bead
//! bk0o.2; [F] — behind the `diff-mitigations` feature until its
//! Gauntlet tier is green). Remeshing is genuinely non-differentiable
//! across topology events; rather than pretend otherwise, three
//! mitigations apply IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE:
//!
//! 1. DIFFERENTIABILITY AS A ROUTING REQUIREMENT — the Rep Router's
//!    fitness gains a differentiability term (implemented at the cost
//!    -oracle seam: non-differentiable edges carry a penalty when a
//!    query requests gradients), so SDF/spline paths are PREFERRED and
//!    multi-representation becomes the asset that provides
//!    differentiable paths where mesh-locked pipelines have none;
//! 2. HADAMARD boundary-form shape derivatives that avoid mesh
//!    sensitivities entirely where applicable (the base crate's
//!    `hadamard` module, wired as the mesh-free path);
//! 3. where a remesh event is UNAVOIDABLE inside the differentiation
//!    path: the gradient is emitted with ESTIMATED color (Proposal 3)
//!    plus a declared DISCONTINUITY FLAG — never a silently-wrong
//!    verified gradient.

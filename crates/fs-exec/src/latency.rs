//! The latency lane: asupersync's native async scheduling for orchestration
//! (plan §5.2) — ledger I/O, IR interpretation, progress streaming,
//! watchdogs. Milliseconds matter, throughput doesn't; this lane is what
//! keeps HELM conversational while the tile pool saturates the cores.
//!
//! fs-exec deliberately adds NO scheduling policy of its own here: the lane
//! is a thin, configured handle on the asupersync runtime, so its
//! cancellation semantics (request → drain → finalize through region state
//! machines) apply unmodified.

//! Parked worker crew (bead tkr7): N OS threads park on a condvar INSIDE

//! `Cx::scoped_cpu` — bead lx0e) and execute per-run jobs handed over by
//! reference, so repeated `TilePool` runs reuse warm workers instead of
//! respawning per run (the measured N-D FFT attainment collapse: every
//! axis pass respawned the pool, 0.011 attainment at 256×256 on a
//! 5995WX).
//!
//! CAPSULE: the ONE unsafe operation is the lifetime erasure of the job
//! borrow in [`Crew::dispatch`] — the rayon-latch argument: dispatch
//! publishes the borrow, wakes the crew, and BLOCKS until every worker
//! has reported completion and the slot is cleared, so the erased borrow
//! provably outlives every dereference. See SAFETY.md beside this file.

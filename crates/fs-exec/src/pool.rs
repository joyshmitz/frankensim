//! The throughput lane: a work-stealing fork-join tile pool (plan §5.2).
//!
//! Semantics first, lock-freedom later: workers own per-worker deques
//! (`CachePadded<Mutex<VecDeque>>`) seeded with contiguous, weight-
//! proportional tile ranges; an empty worker steals HALF a victim's deque,
//! visiting same-CCD victims before cross-CCD ones (plan §5.1 consequence
//! 3). The protocol — weighted quanta, CCD-local-first stealing, fixed-slot
//! reductions, drain-on-cancel, panic containment — is the contract; the
//! Chase–Lev lock-free deque is a later optimization gated on roofline
//! evidence (CONTRACT no-claims).
//!
//! Determinism (P2): every tile's output lands in its OWN slot and slots
//! fold in ascending tile order, so results are bit-identical across worker
//! counts and steal schedules by construction. RNG stream keys derive from
//! logical identity only.

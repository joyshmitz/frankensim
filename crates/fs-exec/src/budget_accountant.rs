//! The shared admitted-budget accountant (bead frankensim-sj31i.6).
//!
//! Root cause this module closes: workflows hash `Cx::budget()` fields
//! into provenance identity but enforce, at best, a locally-consumed
//! poll quota — deadline and cost quota were never uniformly enforced,
//! so a `Budget::ZERO` invocation could complete successfully while its
//! provenance claimed a zero allowance. This accountant makes the
//! hashed budget and the enforced budget THE SAME CONTRACT: it is
//! admitted once from the ambient `Cx` budget plus the checked work
//! plan's declared cost, and every deterministic tile boundary then
//! passes through [`AdmittedBudget::checkpoint`] /
//! [`AdmittedBudget::charge_cost`].
//!
//! Semantics:
//! - Admission refuses an already-expired deadline (including
//!   `Budget::ZERO`'s `Some(Time::ZERO)`) and a declared cost plan that
//!   exceeds the cost quota, before any work runs.
//! - Checkpoints enforce, in order: cancellation (always takes
//!   precedence), deadline under the caller-supplied deterministic
//!   [`TimeSource`], then poll quota. `u32::MAX` polls and a `None`
//!   deadline/cost quota mean unlimited (asupersync's sentinels).
//! - Refusals latch: after the first refusal every subsequent call
//!   returns the same reason, so exhausted work cannot smuggle a
//!   partial success past its own refusal ("no-partial-success").
//! - [`AdmittedBudget::consumption`] retains the final consumption and
//!   the latched refusal reason for evidence, exactly as they were
//!   enforced.
//!
//! The accountant deliberately has no children, memory leases, or
//! receipt hashing — that is [`crate::InvocationBudget`]'s contract for
//! nested science. This type is the uniform tile-boundary enforcement
//! primitive those workflows were missing.

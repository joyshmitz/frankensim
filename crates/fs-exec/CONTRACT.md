# CONTRACT: fs-exec

## Purpose and layer
Two-lane executor (plan §5.2): the latency lane is asupersync's async
scheduling for orchestration; the throughput lane is a work-stealing
fork-join tile pool with weighted quanta, CCD-local-first stealing, and
fixed-shape reductions. Owns the `Cx`/`TileKernel` contract every hot
kernel programs against. Layer: L0. Depends on asupersync, fs-alloc,
fs-substrate, fs-obs.

## Public types and semantics
- `Cx<'s>` — the per-tile context (plan Appendix B): `checkpoint()` /
  `is_cancel_requested()` poll the run's `CancelGate` (the MANDATORY
  tile-boundary poll), `arena()` is the tile-scoped fs-alloc arena
  (lifetime-bound; escapes are compile errors), `stream_key()` is the
  logical RNG identity, `budget()` carries asupersync's `Budget`
  vocabulary, `mode()` the `ExecMode` provenance.
- `StreamKey { seed, kernel_id, tile, iteration }` + `key128()` — RNG
  stream identity derived from LOGICAL work identity only, never from the
  worker (Decalogue P2). fs-rand's Philox consumes the 128-bit key.
- `CancelGate` — request → drain → finalize: `request()` is idempotent and
  stamps the first-request time; workers finish their current tile, stop
  claiming, and the run returns a structured outcome. Timestamps feed
  reports only, never results.
- `TileKernel` (`type Out: Reduce; tiles() -> TilePlan; run(tile, &Cx) ->
  ControlFlow<Cancelled, Out>`) and `TilePlan { tiles, kernel }` with the
  FNV-stable `kernel_id()`.
- `Reduce` — fold identity + `merge`, applied over per-tile slots on the
  FIXED-SHAPE pairwise tree: split at the largest power of two below `n`,
  recurse — shape a pure function of the tile count, items visited in
  ascending index order, so `merge` need not be commutative. Implemented
  for `()`, `u64`, `f64`, `Vec<T>`, `reduce::Compensated`.
- `reduce` module (plan §5.4, the P2 machinery): `pairwise_fold`,
  Neumaier `Compensated` partials (Reduce-composable), `det_sum`/`det_dot`
  /`det_norm2` (256-element blocked, unfused products), `det_min`/`det_max`
  (IEEE total order), `det_argmin`/`det_argmax` (ties -> LOWEST index),
  `det_prefix_sum` (compensated sequential scan), and `audit_accumulator`
  — the G5 order-sensitivity audit that catches arrival-order bugs and
  localizes them to the smallest exposing prefix.
- `TilePool` / `PoolConfig { workers, topo, quantum_weights, seed, mode,
  arena }` — `run(&kernel)` / `run_with_gate(&kernel, &gate) -> (Result<Out,
  RunError>, RunReport)`. Workers are scoped per run; per-worker deques are
  seeded with contiguous, weight-proportional tile runs (`weighted_ranges`)
  and steal HALF a victim's deque in `victim_order` (same-CCD ring first).
- `RunError { Cancelled, TilePanicked, Incomplete }` — structured, teaching
  outcomes with tile provenance. `RunReport` — steal counts, cross-CCD
  steal counts, cancel-latency samples, `cancel_latency_p99_ns()`,
  canonical `to_json()`.
- `LatencyLane` — thin configured handle on the asupersync runtime
  (`block_on`, `runtime()`); no fs-exec scheduling policy of its own.
- `victim_order(worker, workers, topo)` / `weighted_ranges(tiles, weights)`
  — pure, deterministic; these functions ARE what workers use, so fixture
  verification verifies runtime behavior.
- `Racer` / `RacerConfig` / `RaceBranch` / `RaceRun` / `BranchReport` /
  `NoWinner` — speculative races (plan §5.2 behavior 1). Victory rule:
  Deterministic = lowest-index accepted result, recomputed from OUTCOMES
  (timing moves when kills land, never who wins); Fast = first accepted
  arrival, recorded. Early kills: branch j dies once any i<j is accepted;
  a parent gate (kill-handle) cancels the whole tree via a bounded-stride
  watcher. Liveness caveat documented: below-leader branches must
  terminate on their own budgets before the decision seals.
- `solver` module (behavior 2): `SolverState` (in-house little-endian
  codec, floats as raw bits, self-contained bytes — no pointers, content-
  hash references — so "migrate" can someday mean another machine),
  `ResumableSolver::step` (bounded pause granularity), `drive` (pause IS
  the cancellation path), `fork` (round-trips through bytes, proving
  serializability at fork time), `StepVerdict`, `SolverProgress`.
- `Tuner` / `TuneRow` / `TuningDecision` / `TuneSource` / `ScheduleKind` /
  `TuneError` — the autotuner (plan §5.5). `calibrate(&probe)` measures a
  real stencil-edge sweep through the real pool (argmin with
  lowest-index tie law), reduction cost, steal cost, and selects the
  schedule kind from measured per-core bandwidth; rows are keyed kernel ×
  shape-class × MACHINE FINGERPRINT with repeat-agreement confidence and a
  refresh counter (recalibration idempotent). Persistence is a JSON-lines
  file store shaped like the ledger `tune` table (migration = rename);
  foreign-fingerprint rows are stale and ignored on load. Decisions
  (`tile_edge_for`, `schedule`) are RECORDED; studies pin them and replay
  uses recorded plans, never re-tuned ones (replay fidelity). Cold-start
  defaults: 8-cube tiles, bandwidth-rich schedule.
- `KillRegistry` (behavior 3, Bet 8): candidate id -> `Arc<CancelGate>`;
  `kill` (idempotent; unknown id is a non-event), `kill_where` (batch
  elimination, ascending order), `release`. Everything a candidate
  evaluates — pool runs, races, drives — shares its registered gate.

## Invariants
1. Completeness: a non-cancelled, non-panicked run executes every tile in
   `0..plan.tiles` exactly once (exec-001).
2. Fixed-shape reduction: the pairwise tree's shape depends only on the
   tile count, so results are bit-identical across worker counts, steal
   schedules, and repeats — proven with non-associative floats, a
   non-commutative concatenation, and compensated artifact hashes across
   {1,2,P,2P} workers (exec-002/008/009, G5).
3. Stream keys are pure functions of `(seed, kernel_id, tile, iteration)`;
   shuffling worker counts changes nothing (exec-003).
4. Cancellation is request → drain → finalize: after `CancelGate::request`,
   workers claim no new tiles, in-flight tiles finish (or observe the gate
   at their own poll points), arenas reclaim to quiescence, and the run
   returns `RunError::Cancelled` with completed/total counts (exec-004/005).
5. Panic containment: a panicking tile is caught with tile provenance,
   siblings drain via the gate, the pool remains usable, and the process
   NEVER aborts (exec-005 and unit battery).
6. Steal order is CCD-local-first under the fixture topologies; initial
   quanta are weight-proportional within one tile (exec-006).
7. Per-tile arenas come from one `ArenaPool` (chunk-recycled); the pool's
   quiescence oracle is the leak check after every run.
8. Race losers are FULLY drained before `race` returns (scope join), their
   arenas reclaimed (quiescence oracle); the winner (index and bits) is
   identical across timing jitter in Deterministic mode (exec-010).
9. Pause -> serialize -> deserialize -> resume reproduces the
   uninterrupted solver trajectory bit-exactly at any pause depth
   (exec-011, chaotic-map witness); forks are independent and
   serialization-proven at fork time.
10. A registry kill drains the candidate's whole tree at its next poll
    points with arenas quiescent (exec-012, latency ledgered).
11. Tune rows always carry the machine fingerprint; loads drop foreign
    rows; recalibration replaces same-key rows with refresh incremented;
    pinned decisions reproduce identically on ANY machine, calibrated or
    not (exec-013).

## Race drain totality (bead wf9.8.1)

`race_with_gate` is PANIC-TOTAL and hang-free: empty races are refused
with a structured `NoWinner` (empty reports + teaching message) before
any thread spawns; the branch body AND the acceptance predicate run
inside one unwind guard, and the terminal-slot epilogue (slot write +
watcher release) is panic-free by construction (poison-tolerant locks
throughout), so the parent watcher is always released — an accept
panic is a `Panicked` outcome, never a hung scope. `KillRegistry`
locks are poison-tolerant, and `kill_registered` returns a structured
`UnregisteredKill` instead of an ignorable `false` for candidates that
must be wired; flagship consumers (fs-race tournaments) register their
candidates' gates at scope start so eliminations always reach a live
evaluation tree. The G4 storm test drives races under registry-owned
gates with external kills: every kill lands registered, every race
returns, arenas end quiescent.

## Error model
All fallible APIs return structured values (`RunError`, `LaneError`) with
teaching `Display` text. Kernel panics become `RunError::TilePanicked`;
executor-internal invariant violations become `RunError::Incomplete`
(reported, not panicked). The only intentional panics are lock-poisoning
`expect`s (reachable only after a panic already contained elsewhere) and
kernel-authored asserts, which are contained per invariant 5.

## Determinism class
Deterministic (P2): results and stream keys are bit-stable across runs,
worker counts, and steal schedules on the same ISA, by construction
(slot-per-tile + length-keyed pairwise tree + logical keys). Tie-breaking
law: argmin/argmax ties resolve to the lowest logical index; float
comparisons use IEEE total order. Cross-ISA: identical shapes reduce
divergence to scalar-arithmetic classes (FMA contraction, libm ULP) owned
by fs-math and reported by the G5 cross-ISA report once the second-ISA
runner lands. `ExecMode::Fast` currently shares the same reduction shape
and exists as recorded provenance for the future relaxation. Timing values (steal counts, latencies) are measurements
quarantined in `RunReport`/events, never in results.

## Cancellation behavior
The throughput lane polls the gate at every tile boundary and requires
kernels to poll `cx.checkpoint()` at bounded strides inside long tiles;
drain semantics per invariant 4. The latency lane inherits asupersync's
region state machine (request → drain → finalize) unmodified. Cancel
latency is MEASURED per run (histogram in `RunReport`, ledgered via events);
see no-claims for the 200 µs target's status.

## Unsafe boundary
None. The pool is safe Rust (scoped threads, mutex deques, atomics);
`catch_unwind` is safe containment. Lock-free deques, if they ever land,
arrive as a registered capsule with a SAFETY.md.

## Feature flags
None. Everything here is `[S]` solid-tier.

## Conformance tests
tests/conformance.rs, cases exec-001..exec-008 (JSON-line verdicts; seeded
cases carry seeds): completeness/arena hygiene, G5 bit-identity across
worker counts, stream-key worker-independence, external-cancel drain with
ledgered latency histogram, the 300-run G4 storm with panic injection,
steal-order/quanta fixtures, latency-lane responsiveness under saturation,
reduction-shape invariance, the exec-009 G5 audit (compensated
artifact hashes bit-stable across {1,2,P,2P} workers; seeded arrival-order
bug caught with prefix localization), exec-010 (deterministic race victory
under jitter + loser drain), exec-011 (bit-exact checkpoint/resume/fork on
a chaotic trajectory), exec-012 (kill-handle drains a deep tree,
latency ledgered), and exec-013 (calibrate -> persist -> consume round
trip; fingerprint keying; idempotent recalibration; pinned replay).
tests/constellation_smoke.rs pins the
asupersync Budget vocabulary. In-module unit suites cover the gate, keys,
Reduce laws, partitioning, victim orders, self-cancellation, and pool
survival after panics.

## No-claim boundaries
- NO 200 µs cancel-latency CLAIM yet: the reference-hardware p99 gate
  belongs to the roofline/perf harness with release builds and machine
  fingerprints; today the histogram is measured and ledgered per run, with
  a generous sanity envelope in CI (exec-004).
- NO lock-free deque claim: the v1 deques are mutex-based with the correct
  stealing PROTOCOL; Chase–Lev arrives only with roofline evidence that
  justifies its unsafe capsule.
- Workers are scoped per run (spawn cost ~tens of µs amortized over a
  kernel run); the persistent parked-worker pool is deferred with the same
  evidence bar.
- NO thread-pinning/NUMA-binding claim: `victim_order` steers locality;
  actual affinity syscalls are outside safe std (fs-substrate no-claim
  applies). P/E quantum WEIGHTS are plumbed but their values await the
  autotuner.
- Budget enforcement beyond cancellation (poll quotas, deadlines) is
  carried in the `Cx` but enforced by the session governor when HELM
  lands; `Budget` here is vocabulary and provenance.
- The latency lane's ≤100 ms conversational guarantee is HELM's gate;
  exec-007 measures and ledgers turnaround without claiming it.
- `ExecMode::Fast`'s 5–15% relaxed-reduction throughput claim is NOT made:
  Fast currently shares the deterministic tree; the relaxation (and its
  measured delta) waits for the roofline harness.
- Race kill-propagation from a parent gate polls at a 50 µs stride
  (measurement-class latency, ledgered); sub-poll-interval propagation
  needs the perf harness like every other latency claim.
- Ledger SPILL of solver checkpoints (revolve-style schedules, artifact
  rows) is fs-ad/fs-ledger territory; this crate owns the snapshot bytes
  and their bit-exactness only.
- NO "calibrated is faster" assertion in CI: debug-profile timing is
  noise; the improvement is DOCUMENTED via the ledgered calibration
  report, and the perf harness owns throughput verdicts (same doctrine as
  every other latency/perf claim here).
- GEMM/prefetch-distance calibration rows arrive when fs-la and the
  stencil-prefetch kernels register their microbenches; the table schema
  and TilePlan service are ready for them. Tropical tune-next analytics
  (Bet 12) is fs-plan's.
- Per-core-class (P/E) bandwidth calibration inherits fs-substrate's
  pinning no-claim; the schedule decision uses aggregate per-core numbers.
- Deterministic hash-map wrappers are not shipped: the contract's rule is
  "no HashMap iteration order in results" (BTreeMap or index-keyed slots
  in hot paths); an enforcement lint belongs to CI tooling.

# fs-session — CONTRACT

Sessions, capability tokens, and the resource GOVERNOR (plan §11.3):
budgets are ENFORCED, not advisory — plus the agent-proofing trio:
idempotency keys, `estimate()` dry runs, and errors as guidance.

Ambition tags: tokens/governor/idempotency/estimate [F per the bead
label; shipped surface tested to [S] discipline].

## Purpose and layer

Layer **L6** (HELM). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-ir (admission bridge +
study parsing), fs-exec (CancelGate/SolverState/TilePool), fs-la (production
GEMM), fs-ledger (persistence/content hash), fs-blake3 (domain-separated
receipt identity), fs-plan (cost models), fs-obs, fs-qty.
Consumers: the P2 marquee demo, the HELM e2e suite (gp3.11).

## Public types and semantics

- `CapabilityToken { session, ops globs, core_s, mem_bytes, wall_s,
  cores, ledger_scope }` — the explicit grant every IR program executes
  under; fallible `to_admission()` validates bounded canonical operator grants
  before cloning them into fs-ir static admission. The
  governor independently validates the declaration at registration and
  continuously meters core-seconds, peak memory, and wall time. Operator names
  and concurrent cores are static-admission fields today, not dynamically
  leased execution resources. Memory
  bytes and concurrent cores remain exact `u64` values through the bridge;
  source count scaling, token comparison, and governor enforcement never
  project those authorities through `f64`. `ledger_scope` is exact authority,
  admitted only as 1..=128 ASCII graphic bytes: whitespace, controls, Unicode
  normalization aliases, and oversized namespaces fail before registration.
  Invalid-scope diagnostics retain only a UTF-8-safe 128-byte preview plus the
  exact input length, so refusing an oversized authority string is itself
  memory-bounded. Operator authority is likewise structural: at most 256
  unique canonical exact names or namespace wildcards ending in `.*`, each
  1..=128 bytes and at most 8 KiB in aggregate, are admitted under fs-ir's
  shared grammar before any governor state changes. Validated strings and the
  operator vector are rebuilt before retention, so caller-chosen spare capacity
  cannot bypass byte accounting.
- `Governor` — `Send + Sync`; hot paths are mutex-guarded in-memory
  state. `new()` creates a process-local opaque namespace;
  `new_durable(ledger, DurableGovernorNonce)` instead derives a restart-stable
  namespace from the checked physical `LedgerInstanceId` and an explicit
  caller-persisted 32-byte nonce. The same ledger+nonce reconstructs the same
  authority hashes after reopen, while a foreign/replacement ledger cannot.
  `session_open_id(session, client_key)` mints a bounded private-field
  retry authority. `open_session(open_id, token)` and its gated form return a
  `SessionOpenReceipt` containing the private `ScopeFlushPermit` bound to the
  exact governor and immutable ledger scope. Exact token plus exact gate-Arc
  replay returns the same receipt and permit even if the gate was subsequently
  requested; altered otherwise-valid token/gate reuse is a structured
  conflict, while structurally invalid payloads retain their validation error.
  A different
  open authority for an occupied `SessionId` remains `SessionAlreadyOpen` and
  cannot replace its immutable token, meters, gate, pause state, or receipts.
  Invalid ledger scope, non-finite/negative floating grants, and a new
  pre-requested gate are refused before registration. Token, optional gate,
  replay registry, and receipt are one atomic critical section.
  `charge(MeterReportId, Charge) -> MeterReceipt` rejects non-finite,
  negative, or overflowing deltas before mutation. Each successful report
  atomically receives a global completion-order commit ordinal and exact pre/post
  `MeterSnapshot`; exact-bit replay returns the same receipt without changing a
  meter, counter, ordinal, revision, or dirty cursor, while altered payload
  reuse conflicts. Enforcement remains `Ok` →
  `Throttled` (at the grant) → `Paused` (past 1.2× the grant, with a
  teaching resume hint). Memory admission compares integer bytes exactly,
  including above f64's 53-bit integer precision, and evaluates the hard
  threshold as `used * 5 > granted * 6`; diagnostic f64 fields do not drive the
  verdict. The governor NEVER silently kills.
- `submission_request_id(session, caller_key, canonical_program)` retains a
  separate caller-key identity and canonical request digest. The opaque
  governor/session/open/generation authority selects the caller-key slot; the
  program digest is its checked payload rather than part of the slot identity,
  so altered-program reuse reaches the same durable authority and conflicts
  after restart. `submit_once(request_id,
  work)` is process-local exactly-once execution on an ephemeral governor: the first caller in that session runs and
  is charged. Same caller key with a different canonical program conflicts
  before work. A concurrent or
  same-thread reentrant caller observing `Pending` returns `InFlight`
  immediately without executing or waiting; a repeat after terminal
  publication receives `Duplicate` with the SAME receipt and NO charge.
  Caller panics and invalid returned charges are contained as a terminal
  `Failed { receipt, evidence }`; no charge is committed, and retry requires an
  explicit new key. A private-field `SubmissionReceipt` is a domain-separated
  BLAKE3 v3 identity of the request, immutable ledger scope, admission ordinal,
  and exact terminal meter receipt or full failure evidence.
  Caller-controlled evidence retains at most 16 KiB of UTF-8-safe preview,
  while its exact byte length and BLAKE3 digest bind the complete original.
  Admission reserves the request slot, worst-case terminal evidence, one meter
  report slot/receipt budget, and future global meter-ordinal capacity before
  caller work begins without allocating the actual commit ordinal. Completion
  allocates that ordinal and publishes meter mutation plus terminal state in one
  lock-held transition; failure releases the report/ordinal reservation. A
  panic or invalid charge therefore cannot strand `Pending` at a byte or causal
  ordinal boundary, and no flush can observe a charge without its terminal row.
  A pause acknowledgement refuses with `PauseDrainPending` while any admitted
  submission in the draining generation is still executing; gate rotation can
  therefore never make completed caller work fail stale and escape metering.
  After cancellation is requested, new submissions refuse while the old gate
  drains and while its replacement is `ReadyToResume`; only exact Pending or
  terminal response replays remain available until explicit activation.
  `Executed` and every later `Duplicate` expose the same `Enforcement`, so a
  throttled/paused charge is never hidden behind a generic success.
  `idempotency_key(agent_key, program)` accepts at most 1 MiB per input,
  separately domain-hashes them, then binds exact lengths and the two digests
  into a fixed-memory v3 key; blank or oversized supplied execution keys are
  refused length-first.
  A durable governor refuses a fresh `submit_once` execution and requires
  `submit_once_durable(ledger, request_id, canonical_program, work)`. That path
  first verifies that the exact session-open terminal already exists on the
  bound physical ledger, then atomically inserts an immutable Pending claim.
  Only the caller receiving fs-ledger's private positive claim permit may run
  `work`. An identical recovered Pending claim returns
  `IndeterminateMutation` without invoking work; an existing terminal is
  decoded and installed without invoking work; different payload bytes under
  the same caller-key authority conflict. Success and failure retain the
  permit through the typed terminal flush. A crash after claim and before
  terminal publication is therefore fail-closed rather than an implicit
  rerun.
- `pressure_action_id(session, client_key)` mints an authority in the current
  execution generation. `apply_memory_pressure(action_id, level) ->
  PressureReceipt` applies the DECLARED
  degradation ladder (`LADDER`: spill coldest arenas → coarsen
  adaptively → pause-serialize-resume) fires steps `1..=level` in order;
  the pause step resolves the session-owned `CancelGate` bound by
  `open_session_gated` and requests it so the solver checkpoints at its next
  tile boundary (P7). Pause gates are generational: level 3 mints a
  private-field `PauseRequestId` bound to this governor, session, old gate
  generation, and request ordinal. `acknowledge_pause(request_id, claim)`
  consumes only that exact generation; while it remains the session's latest
  completed generation, identical response replay returns the same event,
  content receipt, restart-stable semantic gate binding, and process-local
  `Arc<CancelGate>`, while conflicting evidence fails closed. If an external
  owner requests that gate before activation, `activate_resume` refuses it and
  identical acknowledgement replay replaces the never-activated `Arc` at the
  same generation. The old acknowledgement becomes stale by exact pointer
  identity; repeated recovery replay returns the one current replacement.
  The originating `PressureActionId` travels on request and completion events.
  Exact action replay returns the original receipt/event slice before pending,
  ready-to-resume, or stale-generation checks, so response loss never requests
  a gate or reserves a completion twice. Altered in-ladder level reuse
  conflicts, while out-of-ladder input remains `InvalidPressureLevel`; an
  unused action from an old generation is stale. Completed actions are bounded
  rather than silently evicted.
  `PauseAcknowledgement` has private fields and activation compares its full
  event, request, generation, stable binding, content receipt, and exact live
  `Arc` identity with retained state, so a caller-altered acknowledgement
  cannot activate work. Activation returns a replayable
  `ResumeActivationReceipt` rather than an unstructured unit result.
  The fresh gate remains `ReadyToResume` until
  `activate_resume(&acknowledgement)` records that resumed workers adopted it;
  all pressure levels refuse while a request is pending or a gate awaits
  activation. The old gate stays permanently requested so drained workers
  cannot re-enter. Request and completion events bind the old generation.
  Every event carries attribution and a deterministic ordinal. Admitting level
  3 reserves the mandatory future
  completion row, and all other event admission counts outstanding
  reservations so the completion cannot be starved at the cap. The request
  also reserves worst-case retained completion evidence and one global event
  ordinal before it requests the gate. Other event admission must preserve all
  outstanding completion reservations. Pause completion accepts at most 1 MiB
  of checkpoint-claim input and retains it under the bounded
  preview/full-length/full-digest evidence model, releasing unused reserved
  capacity atomically with completion.
  `events_page` is the only event reader and returns at most 1,024 rows under
  the permit's exact scope.
- `estimate(study, cost_models, cores)` — the dry run: p10/p50/p90 wall
  from fs-plan quantile models over `:dof`/`:size` features, declared
  memory ask, energy (p50 × cores × 45 W/core), and an HONEST
  `unmodeled_ops` coverage list (never silent gaps). The result is fallible:
  cores and derived wall/energy values must stay finite and non-negative, and a
  memory Count must scale to an exact positive whole-byte `u64`; zero, negative,
  fractional-byte, wrong-unit, and overflowed asks are structured refusals.
  Operation discovery includes namespaced verbs and any undotted verb present
  in the supplied model registry; registry-backed work cannot silently vanish
  from a dry-run estimate because of its spelling.
  Memory is read only from the recognized study's direct `(budget (mem ...))`
  clause: duplicate or malformed memory clauses fail closed, and a body call
  named `mem` has no authority to grant a budget.
  `unmodeled_ops` means no model exists; a present model that refuses its input,
  emits invalid numbers, or reverses its quantiles is an error, not silently
  relabeled as a coverage gap. An explicitly declared `:dof`, `:size`, or
  `:modes` feature must have one numeric value, and duplicate size features are
  refused instead of silently falling back to the unit-size default.
- `CalibrationReport` — estimate-vs-actual rows, ratio quantiles, and a
  content-addressed ledger artifact (`estimate-calibration`): the cost
  models' own report card. Zero-prediction rows (bead gp3.21) are
  EXCLUDED from ratio quantiles (no invented ratios) but never hidden:
  `zero_prediction_summary()` and the JSON's `zero_predictions` object
  carry their count — split into true-zero (fully modeled) vs unmodeled
  (coverage gap) — plus the raw actual-time quantiles; rows serialize as
  `[predicted, actual, fully_modeled]` triples. `health(&policy)` judges
  the zero-prediction fraction against the governance-configurable
  `CalibrationPolicy` threshold (default 0.25; non-finite or out-of-[0,1]
  thresholds refuse) and returns Healthy or Degraded, never a silent
  pass. Row ingestion rejects negative/non-finite values and
  non-finite ratios before mutation, so its canonical JSON cannot be poisoned
  by `NaN`/infinity spellings.
- `Guidance { code, diagnosis, fixes }` — errors as teaching:
  `from_finding` lifts fs-ir admission findings (the canonical §11.3
  `BudgetInfeasible` fixture) with their cost-model-ranked fixes intact.
- `flush_scope_to_ledger(&ScopeFlushPermit, &Ledger)` — open receipts,
  standalone causal meter receipts, action-bound degradation, and terminal
  submission receipts for sessions whose immutable token grants that exact
  scope, persisted as immutable typed terminal groups in the same transaction
  as their owned `session.*` audit events. Foreign permits fail closed. Every payload carries
  the exact JSON-escaped `ledger_scope`; schemas are open v1, meter-report v1,
  idempotency v5, and degradation v5. Open rows carry the canonical grant and
  operator preimage needed to verify their token digest. Successful submission
  rows are the sole persistence source for their meter commit and carry
  session-open identity, execution generation, request/key/program hashes,
  admission order, derived meter-report authority, full pre/post meter receipt,
  and enforcement. Failed rows carry the same session-open/generation/request
  authority plus bounded error evidence; a flush cannot expose a successful
  charge separately from its terminal outcome. Degradation rows
  carry the action and pressure-receipt
  hashes. L2/L3 pressure groups, pause completion, and zero-event activation
  terminals are indivisible: a bounded batch either admits the complete group
  or defers it. fs-ledger binds every claim to the checked physical ledger,
  durable governor, session-open identity, kind, scope, generation, exact
  payload, terminal receipt, and authenticated owned-event sequence. Its
  internally derived batch identity and immutable membership witnesses make a
  retry after database commit but before cursor publication append zero rows.
  `FlushReport` names appended audit rows, committed-or-verified terminals,
  encoded bytes, and whether more state remains dirty; each call admits at
  most 1,024 terminal groups, 1,024 owned events, and 4 MiB of conservatively
  encoded payload. An unchanged repeated call is a no-op; failed persistence
  leaves every selected generation-aware cursor dirty for retry.
  The call refuses an already-open ledger transaction because it cannot know
  whether the owner will commit or roll back. Preparation reserves one scope
  under the governor mutex, database I/O runs after releasing that mutex, and
  cursor commit validates the reservation plus generation/revision snapshot.
  A concurrent same-scope flush returns `ScopeFlushInFlight`; unrelated hot
  paths remain live. Each scope owns one commit-ordinal-indexed causal set in
  which standalone meter rows and successful submission terminal rows are
  interleaved. A successful terminal substitutes for its private meter row, so
  no later report whose `before` snapshot contains that charge can precede the
  terminal in durable order. Failed submissions occupy a separate non-meter
  lane. A dirty open receipt is always selected before lane rotation, so every
  dependent mutation commits in the same transaction as, or a transaction
  after, the immutable token/open authority it names; a row/byte-limited open
  prefix remains the prerequisite on the next chunk until fully drained. Each
  scope also owns an
  independent event cursor, sink, revision, and flush generation. A rotating
  four-lane start order prevents sustained causal traffic from starving open,
  failed-terminal, or degradation receipts. Its first
  successful non-empty flush binds that scope to
  the ledger's opaque persisted `LedgerInstanceId`, revalidated against the
  live schema before every authority-bearing flush;
  aliases and moved handles remain the same sink, while a replacement file at
  the same path or independent memory ledger is refused before writes.
- `recover_open`, `recover_meter`, `recover_submission`, `recover_pressure`,
  `recover_pause_acknowledgement`, and `recover_resume_activation` rebuild one
  authenticated typed terminal at a time without dirtying a flush cursor.
  Open state is recovered first. Meter and successful-submission receipts must
  be installed in their contiguous global meter-commit order, but an
  authenticated terminal from an older gate generation remains recoverable
  after lifecycle recovery advances the current gate. Degradation and pause
  terminals form one dense global event-ordinal prefix, so skipped or
  interleaved actions refuse before mutation. Before rotating a recovered
  pause, fs-session performs an indexed, one-row bounded ledger probe for any
  unterminated submission claim in the draining generation; finding one
  returns `IndeterminateMutation`. Exact cached acknowledgement/activation
  replay requires the current completed generation and exact process-local
  gate `Arc`, while a prior activation remains replayable after the next L3
  request asks that still-current gate to drain.
- Deterministic hard caps bound retained governor state and public
  materialization: 4,096 sessions/governor, 1,024 sessions/scope, 4,096
  submission keys/session, 8,192 meter reports/session, 4,096 pressure
  actions/session, 65,536 degradation events/scope, 16 KiB evidence
  previews, 64 MiB of retained caller-controlled payload/scope, 256 MiB of
  retained caller-controlled payload/governor, 1,024 event-page and flush rows,
  4 MiB flush bytes, and checked signed-ledger ordinals. Counts bound fixed
  structure overhead; byte budgets conservatively count duplicated key strings,
  token text, event attribution/evidence, and terminal reservations. Limit+1
  refuses before partial mutation.
- `gemm_f64_session_with_pool(tuner, cache_policy, pool, gate, m, n, k, α,
  a, b, β, c)`
  — the production GEMM autotune loop (bead yqug): measure → cache →
  model → cancellation-correct dispatch through one caller-owned, reusable
  `TilePool`. `gemm_f64_session(..., threads, ...)` is the compatibility
  wrapper that constructs an unpinned host pool. The `*_budgeted` forms accept
  an explicit `GemmMemoryEnvelope`; legacy wrappers pass the explicit unbounded
  sentinel. The scoped key binds fs-la's bit semantics version, power-of-two
  shape class, requested/normalized thread budget, memory limit, exact capped
  probe dims (M/K ≤ 512, N ≤ 2048), resolved SIMD tier,
  the executing pool's canonical topology/mode/weights/arena/pin-groups
  identity, implementation version, and generated compiler/profile/codegen
  build fingerprint, plus `GEMM_TUNER_SCHEMA_VERSION`, which must bump whenever
  the producer lattice, probe/sample policy, ranking, or plan mapping changes;
  the ledger key also binds the machine fingerprint.
  `gemm_tune_build_evidence()` exposes that exact build fingerprint together
  with `GemmGraphEvidenceClass`, the fingerprint-bound class identity, and the
  optional full canonical dependency receipt + domain digest. This lets root
  orchestration require and retain the receipt artifact before publication.
  `GEMM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT_DOMAIN` is re-exported so the root can recompute the
  digest from retained bytes without copying a private domain string.
  `OperatorObservedReceipt` means strict receipt structure was validated, not
  that fs-session independently authenticated the operator or reconstructed
  Cargo's invocation-exact unit graph. `DevelopmentEquivalenceSalt` is never
  verified graph evidence.
  Shape/overflow and
  pre-requested-cancel checks happen before any tune mutation; one-thread,
  small-M, and no-product calls bypass tuning. Pinned plans skip measurement;
  else an exact tuner/ledger row is used; else an up-to-4×2 lattice is
  deduplicated by the `(mc,nc)` values fs-la will actually execute and sampled
  three times. Probe A, B, candidate C, and the exact-bit reference are
  fallibly reserved and jointly charged to the session envelope; bounded sweeps
  pass only the remaining child ceiling to fs-la. Every output word from every
  repeat is compared by `f64::to_bits`
  (signed zero and NaN payloads included); drift fails closed. The declared
  model is argmin of minimum wall time with lattice-order tie breaking, not a
  confidence claim. `GemmTuneCache` makes durable access explicit:
  `Disabled`, `ReadOnly`, or `ReadWrite`. Read-only callers may adopt an
  existing validated row but cannot publish during speculative work. A newly
  measured row is sealed as `ValidatedGemmTuneRow` inside `GemmDispatch`; its
  private fields cannot be forged or altered. `receipt_json()` is its canonical
  kernel/shape/machine/params/measured/memory-limit/probe-buffer-plan preimage;
  a public globally unique
  derive-key domain hashes those exact bytes, and
  `publish_to_ledger` participates in an already-open wider transaction.
  Cache adoption returns the same sealed identity on its first dispatch so
  downstream evidence can bind adopted and freshly measured rows uniformly.
  `publish_if_absent_or_identical` lets evidence populate an independent ledger
  but refuses to overwrite a different row already stored under that key.
  `replace_cache_row` is the distinct mutable-cache operation: only a sealed,
  remeasured row can replace stale or malformed dispatch state, and exact
  read-back is required. Replacement is never authority inherited by a delayed
  or cloned benchmark receipt. Read-write mode uses that repair path and
  durably writes the same sealed row before committing it locally. A decision is recorded
  only after fs-la drains and successfully commits the staged output.
  `GemmDispatch.run` carries the final compute counts and every real per-panel
  fs-exec `RunReport`; `execution_receipt()` projects kernel, mode, deterministic
  declared panel ordinal, completed/total counts, and the deterministic memory
  plan into `GemmExecutionReceipt`, explicitly excluding steal, latency,
  worker-distribution, peak-use, and refusal measurements from replay identity.
  `GemmDispatch.kernel` is the exact replay key; replay pins the recorded key
  and params rather than reconstructing a weaker base key.

## Invariants

1. **Enforcement is structured**: every over-grant outcome is `Throttled`
   or `Paused` with resource, used, granted, and a resume hint — no kill
   path exists in the API.
2. **Exactly-once within the owning session and scope**: for any typed
   process-local submission request, `work` runs at most once; all callers in that scope
   observe either non-blocking `InFlight` or the same terminal content-derived
   receipt, and consumption is charged exactly once (16-thread and reentrant
   race-tested). The receipt binds the immutable ledger scope. The same caller
   key in another session is independent and produces a different receipt, so
   one tenant cannot suppress another tenant's work. Reusing a caller-key
   identity with a different canonical request conflicts rather than returning
   stale work. Durable execution additionally requires a fresh immutable
   pre-execution claim; recovered Pending never runs work, while recovered
   terminal replay changes no meter, counter, reservation, gate, cursor, or
   ledger row.
3. **The ladder order is the contract**: spill before coarsen before pause,
   always; pause requests one gate generation, reserves its completion event,
   exact opaque acknowledgement rotates to a fresh gate, and explicit
   activation precedes the next pressure transition. Rotation is refused until
   every admitted submission in the draining generation has published its
   terminal meter outcome. Identical acknowledgement
   replay is idempotent while that completion is latest; a requested
   never-activated resume gate is recoverable by same-generation replay without
   another ledger event, and the replaced acknowledgement cannot activate.
   Activation replay is idempotent while its gate generation remains current,
   including after the next pause requests that gate. `SolverState` snapshots round-trip
   losslessly across repeated pause-resume cycles.
4. **Estimates state their coverage**: unmodeled ops are listed, their
   wall is excluded, nothing is silently assumed.
5. **Meters are exact and replay-safe under storm**: concurrent distinct
   reports accumulate without loss; concurrent identical reports return one
   receipt and commit exactly once. Commit-ordered pre/post snapshots form a
   causal chain independent of scheduling-dependent submission admission.
6. **Every live-process owned idempotency execution terminates**: success or caller panic
   transitions `Pending` exactly once and carries one shared terminal receipt;
   failed work never charges and same-key retry never executes implicitly.
   Successful receipts bind bit-exact charge fields, admission order, causal
   meter receipt, and enforcement verdict; duplicates replay that verdict and
   meter receipt without recharging. A process death can leave a durable claim
   Pending; that state is explicitly indeterminate and is never silently
   terminalized or rerun.
7. **Invalid resources fail closed**: NaN, infinities, negative values, and
   accumulated floating-point overflow are rejected before any token or meter
   mutation. Landing exactly on a grant returns `Throttled`.
8. **GEMM tuning cannot create phantom success**: malformed shapes and
   no-op/serial routes cannot create rows or decisions; cancellation or bit
   drift during measurement cannot create a row; cache failure, foreign
   execution identity, and params/body disagreement cannot install a row.
   Read-only mode performs no ledger writes and exports only an unforgeable
   validated row. In read-write mode, ledger persistence precedes local row
   commit; successful compute precedes decision commit. Cancellation during
   final dispatch may retain its already validated measured row, but records no
   successful decision and leaves caller `C` bitwise intact.
9. **Session identity is immutable and retryable**: exact same
   `SessionOpenId`/token/gate replays the original receipt and permit. A
   different open authority for an existing `SessionId` is a structured
   `SessionAlreadyOpen` refusal. The original capability, meter, cancellation
   gate, pause state, and terminal generations remain unchanged.
10. **Scoped flush is semantic-once and retryable**: one open receipt,
    standalone causal meter report, terminal submission generation, or
    degradation terminal group is appended at most once to the sink bound by
    its token's exact ledger scope, even if the database committed before the
    live cursor advanced. Interleaved
    scopes have independent sink, generation, and degradation cursors. One
    scope's atomic success advances only its cursors; wrong-sink,
    foreign-permit, in-flight refusal, or persistence failure advances none,
    while successful unchanged repeats verify the immutable batch and append
    zero rows. Each bounded chunk
    commits only its prepared cursors and reports whether another chunk or
    concurrently-created state remains dirty.
11. **All retained collections are bounded**: session, scope-session,
    operator-authority, submission-key, meter-report, pressure-action,
    degradation-event plus reserved
    completion row/ordinal, checkpoint-input, evidence-preview,
    per-scope/per-governor retained payload, pagination, flush row/byte, and
    ordinal limits are checked
    before their corresponding state transition. Limit refusal never runs
    caller work or partially advances a cursor, gate, meter, event stream, or
    authority binding.

## Error model

`SessionError`: `UnknownSession`, `SessionAlreadyOpen`,
`MutationAuthorityMismatch`, `MutationConflict`, `StaleMutationGeneration`,
`InvalidLedgerScope`,
`InvalidOperatorGrant`, `DuplicateOperatorGrant`,
`UnknownLedgerScope`, `LedgerScopeSinkMismatch`, `ScopePermitMismatch`,
`ScopeFlushInFlight`, `LimitExceeded`, `InvalidPressureLevel`,
`UngatedSession`, `PauseAlreadyPending`, `PauseDrainPending`,
`SessionGateDraining`,
`PreRequestedGate`, `PauseRequestMismatch`, `PauseAcknowledgementConflict`,
`ResumeNotActivated`, `ResumeAcknowledgementMismatch`,
`ResumeGateAlreadyRequested`, `InvalidResource`, `Submission`, `Persistence`,
`DurableLedgerRequired`, `RecoveryRequired`, `IndeterminateMutation`, `TerminalCorrupt`,
`UnsupportedTerminalSchema`, `RecoveryLedgerMismatch`,
`RecoveryGovernorMismatch`, and `RecoveryCausalGap`.
`GemmTuneError`: cancellation with
the drained numerical report when dispatch began, structured TilePool failure
with tile provenance and its full report, typed tuner refusal, ledger refusal,
exact-bit drift with candidate and repeat, `MemoryRefused` with the outer
session peak plus any fs-la report, or `MemoryPlanOverflow` before unsafe
allocation. Cancellation observed before or between numerical dispatches has
no fs-la report but still retains the outer session peak; cancellation returned
by fs-la and every executor/memory refusal preserve the full drained report.
All such paths leave caller-visible `C` unchanged. Refusals that teach travel
as `Guidance` values with ranked fixes.
A caller-work panic is data, not an unwind across the governor API:
`SubmitOutcome::Failed` records its receipt and bounded retained evidence.

## Determinism class

Governor state transitions are deterministic given the commit order; event,
submission-admission, and meter-commit ordinals are logical (no wall clocks in
ledgered payloads). Concurrency admission/completion order is
scheduling-dependent, but enforcement is authoritative and re-earnable from
commit-ordered meter pre/post receipts. GEMM numerical bits are
independent of the selected MC/NC plan; the wall-clock winner is inherently
environment-dependent and therefore travels as scoped evidence plus an exact
replayable decision.

## Cancellation behavior

The governor is itself a cancellation SOURCE (pause step → CancelGate).
Its own operations are short, bounded critical sections. GEMM sweep and final
dispatch use the same caller-owned pool and poll the same gate inside bounded
packing/microtile work. fs-la stages `C`, stops claiming M-band tiles, drains
all workers and Cx arenas, and commits only after the final poll; cancellation
returns compute plus TilePool progress and leaves caller `C` bit-for-bit
unchanged. The pool's worker lifetime is not yet an asupersync child scope; the
precise no-claim and follow-up live in fs-exec's L0 contract.

## Unsafe boundary

Zero `unsafe`.

## Feature flags

None.

flush, unchanged-call no-op behavior, and dirty-cursor retry after transaction
refusal; ss-003e canonical scope validation plus foreign-permit and page-bound
refusals; ss-003f two-scope interleaving, independent sink binding, exact scoped
payload escaping, cross-scope wrong-sink refusal, and per-scope cursor retry.
ss-003g proves moved handles retain opaque sink identity while independent
ledgers differ; ss-003h drains a limit+1 batch through bounded atomic chunks;
ss-003m/n/o/p cover gated and ungated open/meter response loss, concurrent
open/report replay,
exact payload conflicts and foreign authority, pressure replay across
pending/ready/activated phases plus stale unused generation, same caller
key/different program conflict, and barrier-controlled inverted submission
completion whose meter receipts preserve the required `B=Ok`, `A=Throttled`
causal sequence and flush exactly once. The pause-drain regression proves a
pending submission must meter and terminalize before acknowledgement can rotate
its gate generation, new work is refused throughout draining/ready phases, and
exact terminal replay remains available during both;
ss-011 covers pending/ready pressure refusal, cross-governor request authority,
bounded checkpoint evidence, identical response replay, same-generation
replacement of an externally requested never-activated gate, stale-
acknowledgement refusal, conflicting evidence refusal, explicit idempotent
activation, and repeated generations; ss-012
covers exact session/scope/key boundaries and atomic limit+1 refusal. In-module
tests cover exact flush row/byte limits, event/ordinal/retained-byte caps,
concurrent acknowledgement replay, altered-acknowledgement refusal, multiple
simultaneous reservations,
pagination, and same-scope in-flight reservation refusal.
The durable registry regressions use real on-disk ledger reopen: a fresh
Pending claim executes no closure and rolls back every local reservation;
successful and failed submission terminals recover their original receipt;
altered program reuse conflicts; a restored pre-commit cursor snapshot
replays the exact batch without adding a terminal, membership, or audit row;
and a three-event terminal group is never split at the row boundary.

`tests/gemm_tune.rs` (bead yqug drills): cold start sweeps once and
matches serial bits; ledger warm start seeds a fresh session without
re-measuring; stale (foreign-fingerprint) and invalid cache rows are
refused and re-measured; a requested gate cancels the sweep with no row
and untouched output; pre-requested warm and pinned paths leave output and
decision logs untouched; non-canonical/off-lattice/mis-keyed pins are
structured refusals; replay uses the actual recorded scoped decision and
reproduces the live bits; execution identity separates thread budgets and
exact probes even inside one shape bucket; serial/no-op/small and invalid-shape
paths cannot mutate tuning state; every lattice plan matches serial bits.
An n=640 producer test executes both the two-panel NC=512 route and the
single-panel wider route, proving the NC axis reaches fs-la rather than only
changing evidence labels. Caller-pool drills prove the same pool executes
measurement and final dispatch, the receipt contains real TilePool traversal,
legacy std-thread placement keys are refused, and pinned/unpinned placement
policies cannot share tune rows.
In-module injected Gauntlet tests force exact signed-zero/NaN-payload drift in
each repeat, candidate collapse, between-repeat cancellation, cache-write
failure/retry, params/body disagreement, wrong-probe adoption, and cancelled
dispatch without a success decision. The oracle lane
(`--ignored`, release) asserts the live choice is within the declared
25% tolerance of the exhaustive best-of-3 oracle at the real problem
size and reports its machine — measured 1.000/1.000/1.062 on
macos-aarch64 under ambient load; the second-ISA (x86) counterpart is
armed and runs when an x86 host picks it up.

## No-claim boundaries

- **The governor meters what it is TOLD** (`Charge` deltas from the
  executor); OS-level resource sampling and per-thread accounting are
  the executor/observability beads' territory.
- **Degradation steps are orchestration events**: actual arena spilling and
  adaptive coarsening are fs-alloc/solver behaviors triggered by these events,
  not implemented here. Their v5 phase is therefore `declared`, never
  `applied`. Pause requests, generational gates, exact request
  authority, replay, and activation are wired, but the checkpoint claim passed
  to `acknowledge_pause` is still operator-asserted. fs-session does not yet
  verify a ledger-minted solver-state artifact or an executor drain receipt, so
  `Complete` means "the owning orchestrator acknowledged this request," not an
  independently attested request-drain-finalize proof.
- **Capability issuance is not authenticated yet**: `CapabilityToken` and the
  fs-ir projection are caller-constructible declarations. Registration makes a
  declaration immutable inside one governor, but does not prove an external
  issuer, entitlement, expiry/revocation policy, dynamic operator binding, or a
  shared concurrent-core lease. This authority boundary is tracked by
  `frankensim-authenticate-session-capability-issuance-aeq7`.
- **Recovered Pending execution remains indeterminate by design**: the durable
  claim proves only that the one authorized caller may have started arbitrary
  `FnOnce` work. fs-session cannot infer or compensate external side effects,
  so it returns `IndeterminateMutation` and requires an explicit reconciliation
  decision. Terminal mutation replay, immutable event ownership, gate-state
  reconstruction, and commit-before-cursor append-once are claimed here;
  study-scale kill storms and application-specific side-effect reconciliation
  remain gp3.11 responsibilities.
- **Energy is a declared-constant model** (45 W/core), not measured
  power telemetry; the calibration channel is where reality lands.
- **Terminal durability still follows explicit scope flush**: the
  pre-execution submission claim is committed before work, but its success or
  failure receipt becomes restart-replayable only when
  `flush_scope_to_ledger` commits the typed terminal and owned event. A crash
  in between is safely Pending/indeterminate, not a claimed recovered result.
- **Each exact ledger scope flushes to one owning sink**: per-scope in-memory
  cursors prevent duplicate appends, while a later different sink for that
  scope is refused by opaque `LedgerInstanceId` before writes rather than
  receiving a partial history. Paths are not sink identity.
  Different scopes can bind independent sinks. Cross-ledger replication of one
  scope remains an event-log concern above this API.
- **Two-lane executor integration** (interactive vs batch lanes with
  core quotas) is deferred to gp3.11's study-scale batteries; the
  enforcement/idempotency/estimate surfaces here are what it composes.
- fs-session exposes fs-la's exact dependency receipt and trust class but does
  not upgrade it: correspondence between an operator-supplied receipt and the
  invoking Cargo build remains operator-trusted. Root publication from a
  development-salt build is not claimed as receipt-backed evidence.
- A mutex self-deadlock in the calibration renderer was found by the
  conformance run and fixed (single lock scope). That renderer remains
  non-reentrant; governor idempotency separately guarantees that same-thread
  duplicate submission returns `InFlight` rather than deadlocking.
- GEMM minimum-wall-time ranking is a deterministic selection rule over the
  recorded samples, not statistical confidence. The x86 oracle lane remains
  armed rather than claimed as measured until it runs on the reference host.
- The session envelope covers the four dominant numeric tune buffers, every
  fs-la-owned dispatch reservation, AND the session tune-metadata plan (bead
  wf9.15.1): candidate/ranking/observation collections (BTreeSet dedup was
  replaced by a bounded linear scan — tree-node overhead is not honestly
  accountable), one reused sample buffer plus per-observation exact copies,
  canonical plan labels, and the sealed-row strings, all with documented
  caps ENFORCED at observation/seal time. `run_sweep` charges the plan
  constant after the probe buffers clear the envelope alone (refusal
  `what: "tune-metadata-plan"`, before any allocation, never losing a
  validated fs-la report) and the child envelope excludes probe + plan
  bytes. The plan is a pure constant of the sweep lattice and schema caps —
  `gemm_tune_metadata_plan_bytes()` / `GEMM_TUNE_METADATA_PLAN_SCHEMA` — and
  every sealed row binds it into `receipt_json` as `metadata_plan`, so a
  freshly measured row and the same row adopted later derive the identical
  `receipt_identity`. Introducing the field rotates pre-plan row identities
  once (stored ledger cache rows re-tune on first touch — the same rotation
  class as a build-fingerprint change). Generic TilePool metadata remains
  the separate `frankensim-epic-substrate-wf9.16` boundary.

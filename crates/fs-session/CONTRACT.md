# fs-session — CONTRACT

Sessions, capability tokens, and the resource GOVERNOR (plan §11.3):
budgets are ENFORCED, not advisory — plus the agent-proofing trio:
idempotency keys, `estimate()` dry runs, and errors as guidance.

Ambition tags: tokens/governor/idempotency/estimate [F per the bead
label; shipped surface tested to [S] discipline].

## Purpose and layer

Layer **L6** (HELM). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-ir (admission bridge +
study parsing), fs-exec (CancelGate/SolverState/TilePool), fs-govern
(PR-001–PR-012 program-risk data/evaluation), fs-la (production GEMM),
fs-ledger (persistence/content hash), fs-blake3 (domain-separated receipt
identity), fs-package (exact receipt-schema catalog metadata), fs-plan (cost
models), fs-obs, fs-qty.
Consumers: the P2 marquee demo, the HELM e2e suite (gp3.11).

## Public types and semantics

- `CapabilityToken { session, ops globs, core_s, mem_bytes, wall_s,
  cores, ledger_scope }` — the explicit grant every IR program executes
  under; fallible `to_admission()` validates bounded canonical operator grants
  before cloning them into fs-ir static admission. The
  governor independently validates the declaration at registration and
  continuously meters core-seconds, peak memory, and wall time. Operator names
  and concurrent cores are static-admission fields today, not dynamically
  leased execution resources. Memory
  bytes and concurrent cores remain exact `u64` values through the bridge;
  source count scaling, token comparison, and governor enforcement never
  project those authorities through `f64`. `ledger_scope` is exact authority,
  admitted only as 1..=128 ASCII graphic bytes: whitespace, controls, Unicode
  normalization aliases, and oversized namespaces fail before registration.
  Invalid-scope diagnostics retain only a UTF-8-safe 128-byte preview plus the
  exact input length, so refusing an oversized authority string is itself
  memory-bounded. Operator authority is likewise structural: at most 256
  unique canonical exact names or namespace wildcards ending in `.*`, each
  1..=128 bytes and at most 8 KiB in aggregate, are admitted under fs-ir's
  shared grammar before any governor state changes. Validated strings and the
  operator vector are rebuilt before retention, so caller-chosen spare capacity
  cannot bypass byte accounting.
- `Governor` — `Send + Sync`; hot paths are mutex-guarded in-memory
  state. `new()` creates a process-local opaque namespace;
  `new_durable(ledger, DurableGovernorNonce)` instead derives a restart-stable
  namespace from the checked physical `LedgerInstanceId` and an explicit
  caller-persisted 32-byte nonce. The same ledger+nonce reconstructs the same
  authority hashes after reopen, while a foreign/replacement ledger cannot.
  `session_open_id(session, client_key)` mints a bounded private-field
  retry authority. `open_session(open_id, token)` and its gated form return a
  `SessionOpenReceipt` containing the private `ScopeFlushPermit` bound to the
  exact governor and immutable ledger scope. Exact token plus exact gate-Arc
  replay returns the same receipt and permit even if the gate was subsequently
  requested; altered otherwise-valid token/gate reuse is a structured
  conflict, while structurally invalid payloads retain their validation error.
  A different
  open authority for an occupied `SessionId` remains `SessionAlreadyOpen` and
  cannot replace its immutable token, meters, gate, pause state, or receipts.
  Invalid ledger scope, non-finite/negative floating grants, and a new
  pre-requested gate are refused before registration. Token, optional gate,
  replay registry, and receipt are one atomic critical section.
  `charge(MeterReportId, Charge) -> MeterReceipt` rejects non-finite,
  negative, or overflowing deltas before mutation. Each successful report
  atomically receives a global completion-order commit ordinal and exact pre/post
  `MeterSnapshot`; exact-bit replay returns the same receipt without changing a
  meter, counter, ordinal, revision, or dirty cursor, while altered payload
  reuse conflicts. Enforcement remains `Ok` →
  `Throttled` (at the grant) → `Paused` (past 1.2× the grant, with a
  teaching resume hint). Memory admission compares integer bytes exactly,
  including above f64's 53-bit integer precision, and evaluates the hard
  threshold as `used * 5 > granted * 6`; diagnostic f64 fields do not drive the
  verdict. The governor NEVER silently kills.
- `submission_request_id(session, caller_key, canonical_program)` retains a
  separate caller-key identity and canonical request digest. The opaque
  governor/session/open/generation authority selects the caller-key slot; the
  program digest is its checked payload rather than part of the slot identity,
  so altered-program reuse reaches the same durable authority and conflicts
  after restart. `submit_once(request_id,
  work)` is process-local exactly-once execution on an ephemeral governor: the first caller in that session runs and
  is charged. Same caller key with a different canonical program conflicts
  before work. A concurrent or
  same-thread reentrant caller observing `Pending` returns `InFlight`
  immediately without executing or waiting; a repeat after terminal
  publication receives `Duplicate` with the SAME receipt and NO charge.
  Caller panics and invalid returned charges are contained as a terminal
  `Failed { receipt, evidence }`; no charge is committed, and retry requires an
  explicit new key. A private-field `SubmissionReceipt` is a domain-separated
  BLAKE3 v3 identity of the request, immutable ledger scope, admission ordinal,
  and exact terminal meter receipt or full failure evidence.
  Caller-controlled evidence retains at most 16 KiB of UTF-8-safe preview,
  while its exact byte length and BLAKE3 digest bind the complete original.
  Admission reserves the request slot, worst-case terminal evidence, one meter
  report slot/receipt budget, and future global meter-ordinal capacity before
  caller work begins without allocating the actual commit ordinal. Completion
  allocates that ordinal and publishes meter mutation plus terminal state in one
  lock-held transition; failure releases the report/ordinal reservation. A
  panic or invalid charge therefore cannot strand `Pending` at a byte or causal
  ordinal boundary, and no flush can observe a charge without its terminal row.
  A pause acknowledgement refuses with `PauseDrainPending` while any admitted
  submission in the draining generation is still executing; gate rotation can
  therefore never make completed caller work fail stale and escape metering.
  After cancellation is requested, new submissions refuse while the old gate
  drains and while its replacement is `ReadyToResume`; only exact Pending or
  terminal response replays remain available until explicit activation.
  `Executed` and every later `Duplicate` expose the same `Enforcement`, so a
  throttled/paused charge is never hidden behind a generic success.
  `idempotency_key(agent_key, program)` accepts at most 1 MiB per input,
  separately domain-hashes them, then binds exact lengths and the two digests
  into a fixed-memory v3 key; blank or oversized supplied execution keys are
  refused length-first.
  A durable governor refuses a fresh `submit_once` execution and requires
  `submit_once_durable(ledger, request_id, canonical_program, work)`. That path
  first verifies that the exact session-open terminal already exists on the
  bound physical ledger, then atomically inserts an immutable Pending claim
  that binds the governor-global admission ordinal. The ledger enforces one
  owner per governor/kind/ordinal and refuses a submission terminal whose
  pre-execution claim or positive permit is absent.
  Only the caller receiving fs-ledger's private positive claim permit may run
  `work`. An identical recovered Pending claim returns
  `IndeterminateMutation` without invoking work; an existing terminal is
  decoded and installed without invoking work; different payload bytes under
  the same caller-key authority conflict. Success and failure retain the
  permit through the typed terminal flush. A crash after claim and before
  terminal publication is therefore fail-closed rather than an implicit
  rerun.
- `pressure_action_id(session, client_key)` mints an authority in the current
  execution generation. `apply_memory_pressure(action_id, level) ->
  PressureReceipt` applies the DECLARED
  degradation ladder (`LADDER`: spill coldest arenas → coarsen
  adaptively → pause-serialize-resume) fires steps `1..=level` in order;
  the pause step resolves the session-owned `CancelGate` bound by
  `open_session_gated` and requests it so the solver checkpoints at its next
  tile boundary (P7). Pause gates are generational: level 3 mints a
  private-field `PauseRequestId` bound to this governor, session, old gate
  generation, and request ordinal; `checkpoint_authority()` exposes only its
  domain-separated ledger binding. `acknowledge_pause(request_id, ledger,
  receipt)` consumes only a `SolverCheckpointReceipt` whose session, pause
  authority, and gate generation match, then makes the ledger independently
  re-earn the receipt row, physical instance, solver-state artifact, generic
  snapshot envelope, run provenance, and executor drain report. While it
  remains the session's latest
  completed generation, identical response replay returns the same event,
  content receipt, restart-stable semantic gate binding, and process-local
  `Arc<CancelGate>`, while conflicting evidence fails closed. If an external
  owner requests that gate before activation, `activate_resume` refuses it and
  identical acknowledgement replay replaces the never-activated `Arc` at the
  same generation. The old acknowledgement becomes stale by exact pointer
  identity; repeated recovery replay returns the one current replacement.
  The originating `PressureActionId` travels on request and completion events.
  Exact action replay returns the original receipt/event slice before pending,
  ready-to-resume, or stale-generation checks, so response loss never requests
  a gate or reserves a completion twice. Altered in-ladder level reuse
  conflicts, while out-of-ladder input remains `InvalidPressureLevel`; an
  unused action from an old generation is stale. Completed actions are bounded
  rather than silently evicted.
  A successful acknowledgement is itself an authority-bearing ledger use: it
  binds an as-yet-unbound ledger scope to the receipt's physical ledger, and a
  previously bound scope or durable governor refuses a receipt from another
  ledger before changing gate state.
  `PauseAcknowledgement` has private fields and activation compares its full
  event, request, generation, stable binding, content receipt, and exact live
  `Arc` identity with retained state, so a caller-altered acknowledgement
  cannot activate work. Activation returns a replayable
  `ResumeActivationReceipt` rather than an unstructured unit result.
  The fresh gate remains `ReadyToResume` until
  `activate_resume(&acknowledgement)` records that resumed workers adopted it;
  all pressure levels refuse while a request is pending or a gate awaits
  activation. The old gate stays permanently requested so drained workers
  cannot re-enter. Request and completion events bind the old generation.
  Every event carries attribution and a deterministic ordinal. Admitting level
  3 reserves the mandatory future
  completion row, and all other event admission counts outstanding
  reservations so the completion cannot be starved at the cap. The request
  also reserves worst-case fixed receipt evidence and one global event
  ordinal before it requests the gate. Other event admission must preserve all
  outstanding completion reservations. Pause completion retains the 64-byte
  hexadecimal receipt identity under the bounded evidence model and attributes
  the exact artifact, run, and drain-report hashes, releasing unused reserved
  capacity atomically with completion. Caller-authored strings and booleans
  cannot complete a pause.
  `events_page` is the only event reader and returns at most 1,024 rows under
  the permit's exact scope. It captures only shallow `Arc` references while
  holding the governor mutex; cloning evidence-bearing public rows happens
  after releasing it.
- `grant` module (bead aeq7, increment 1): `CapabilityToken` is
  demoted to an untrusted REQUEST; authority is an opaque
  `SessionGrant` minted only by `mint_grant` through an injected
  `IssuerPolicy` (deny-all `NoIssuerPolicy` default). The grant's
  canonical digest binds issuer id, policy fingerprint, session,
  ledger scope, sorted operator set, budgets, issuance/expiry, and the
  policy's revocation generation; `verify_fresh` refuses forged,
  altered, expired, revoked, and cross-issuer grants. `CoreLeaseBook`
  meters concurrent cores per session and refuses ungranted verbs at
  lease acquisition; leases release on drop. NO-CLAIM (increment
  boundary): the governor's `open_session` still accepts the legacy
  token and is not yet gated on grants; external issuer signature
  verification is future scope landing at the `IssuerPolicy` trait
  boundary.
- `long_job` module (bead h61n): `LongJobRequest` is a pure canonical identity
  envelope for `HybridMachine` and `TheoremCheck` work. Its v1 identity binds
  the closed job-kind tag, exact operator, nonzero integer core-time/memory/
  wall-time/concurrency request, canonical program hash, model family/version,
  state-schema version, exact model-instance/contract/code hashes, an
  caller-supplied expected receipt-catalog pin, and the exact resume-family,
  wire-schema, and descriptor identities. `ResumableModelIdentity` captures a
  `DeclaredResumeSchema` from a validated `ReceiptSchemaDescriptor`.
  `LongJobRequest::try_new` verifies canonical catalog bytes against the
  expected pin, performs exact `ReceiptSchemaCatalog::require_exact` lookup
  with no version fallback, refuses digest-only rows because they cannot govern
  replayable state bytes, and requires the descriptor's maximum canonical byte
  count to fit within the whole-job memory request. Names and budgets are
  bounded/validated before retention. Catalog-pin authority and provenance are
  external. This module has no governor mutation surface: it defines request
  identity and declared resume-schema metadata only.
- `estimate(study, cost_models, cores)` — the dry run: p10/p50/p90 wall
  from fs-plan quantile models over `:dof`/`:size` features, declared
  memory ask, energy (p50 × cores × 45 W/core), and an HONEST
  `unmodeled_ops` coverage list (never silent gaps). Models are
  `fs_plan::SealedCostModel` (bead 2pmb) and the result carries
  `weakest_cost_evidence`: `None` with no modeled calls, otherwise
  weakest-wins across contributors — one provisional model marks the
  whole estimate, and mixing never upgrades receipt-backed evidence. Before
  evidence folding or pricing, each caller registry key must exactly match the
  model's intrinsic operation scope; a foreign scope returns
  `CostModelScopeMismatch`, and string aliases require a separately admitted
  binding. The result is fallible:
  cores and derived wall/energy values must stay finite and non-negative, and a
  memory Count must scale to an exact positive whole-byte `u64`; zero, negative,
  fractional-byte, wrong-unit, and overflowed asks are structured refusals.
  Operation discovery includes namespaced verbs and any undotted verb present
  in the supplied model registry; registry-backed work cannot silently vanish
  from a dry-run estimate because of its spelling.
  Memory is read only from the recognized study's direct `(budget (mem ...))`
  clause: duplicate or malformed memory clauses fail closed, and a body call
  named `mem` has no authority to grant a budget.
  `unmodeled_ops` means no model exists; a present model that refuses its input,
  emits invalid numbers, or reverses its quantiles is an error, not silently
  relabeled as a coverage gap. An explicitly declared `:dof`, `:size`, or
  `:modes` feature must have one numeric value, and duplicate size features are
  refused instead of silently falling back to the unit-size default.
- `CalibrationReport` — estimate-vs-actual rows, ratio quantiles, and a
  content-addressed ledger artifact (`estimate-calibration`): the cost
  models' own report card. Zero-prediction rows (bead gp3.21) are
  EXCLUDED from ratio quantiles (no invented ratios) but never hidden:
  `zero_prediction_summary()` and the JSON's `zero_predictions` object
  carry their count — split into true-zero (fully modeled) vs unmodeled
  (coverage gap) — plus the raw actual-time quantiles; rows serialize as
  `[predicted, actual, fully_modeled]` triples. `health(&policy)` judges
  the zero-prediction fraction against the governance-configurable
  `CalibrationPolicy` threshold (default 0.25; non-finite or out-of-[0,1]
  thresholds refuse) and returns Healthy or Degraded, never a silent
  pass. Row ingestion rejects negative/non-finite values and
  non-finite ratios before mutation, so its canonical JSON cannot be poisoned
  by `NaN`/infinity spellings.
- `Guidance { code, diagnosis, fixes }` — errors as teaching:
  `from_finding` lifts fs-ir admission findings (the canonical §11.3
  `BudgetInfeasible` fixture) with their cost-model-ranked fixes intact.
- `flush_scope_to_ledger(&ScopeFlushPermit, &Ledger)` — open receipts,
  standalone causal meter receipts, action-bound degradation, and terminal
  submission receipts for sessions whose immutable token grants that exact
  scope, persisted as immutable typed terminal groups in the same transaction
  as their owned `session.*` audit events.
  TWO-TIER SUBMISSION MODEL (bead e61t6): only DURABLE submissions
  (`submit_once_durable`, whose pre-execution claim and positive permit
  already live in the recovery ledger) produce flushable submission
  terminals — the ledger's preclaim doctrine refuses the rest, and
  flush-time claim fabrication is laundering, refused by design. Plain
  `submit_once` receipts are in-memory evidence that never flushes; a
  scope carrying one cannot flush at all. A durable governor also binds
  EVERY scope's sink to its recovery ledger at construction, so scope
  isolation is a per-scope-cursor property over one shared sink
  (foreign sinks refuse `LedgerScopeSinkMismatch`), and the session-open
  terminal must flush before the scope's first durable submission
  (`RecoveryRequired` otherwise). Foreign permits fail closed. Every payload carries
  the exact JSON-escaped `ledger_scope`; schemas are open v1, meter-report v1,
  idempotency v5, and degradation v5. Open rows carry the canonical grant and
  operator preimage needed to verify their token digest. Successful submission
  rows are the sole persistence source for their meter commit and carry
  session-open identity, execution generation, request/key/program hashes,
  admission order, derived meter-report authority, full pre/post meter receipt,
  and enforcement. Failed rows carry the same session-open/generation/request
  authority plus bounded error evidence; a flush cannot expose a successful
  charge separately from its terminal outcome. Degradation rows
  carry the action and pressure-receipt
  hashes. L2/L3 pressure groups, pause completion, and zero-event activation
  terminals are indivisible: a bounded batch either admits the complete group
  or defers it. fs-ledger binds every claim to the checked physical ledger,
  durable governor, session-open identity, kind, scope, generation, exact
  payload, terminal receipt, and authenticated owned-event sequence. Its
  internally derived batch identity and fully rehashed complete membership
  preimages make a retry after database commit but before cursor publication
  append zero rows. A terminal may carry up to 1,024 independently verified
  batch witnesses because a mixed retry can legitimately re-witness an
  already committed terminal beside a new one; every witness must reproduce
  its complete ordered batch identity. Submission claim insertion
  and pause-acknowledgement terminalization also carry reciprocal generation
  fences: old-generation work cannot claim after the successor pause terminal,
  and a pause terminal cannot commit while an omitted draining-generation
  submission remains Pending. Flush preparation likewise defers a control-first
  pause acknowledgement until each dirty predecessor is already selected into
  that transaction or committed by an earlier flush, preventing a size-limited
  lane prefix from retrying forever.
  `FlushReport` names appended audit rows, committed-or-verified terminals,
  encoded bytes, and whether more state remains dirty; each call admits at
  most 1,024 terminal groups, 1,024 owned events, and 4 MiB of conservatively
  encoded payload. An unchanged repeated call is a no-op; failed persistence
  leaves every selected generation-aware cursor dirty for retry.
  The call refuses an already-open ledger transaction because it cannot know
  whether the owner will commit or roll back. Under the governor mutex,
  preparation validates the scope, selects at most 1,024 immutable
  `Arc`-backed sources, and installs one reservation. Evidence cloning plus
  JSON/binary terminal materialization and database I/O run after releasing
  that mutex; cursor commit reacquires it and validates the reservation plus
  generation/revision. A concurrent same-scope flush returns
  `ScopeFlushInFlight`; unrelated hot paths remain live. Each scope owns one
  commit-ordinal-indexed causal set in
  which standalone meter rows and successful submission terminal rows are
  interleaved. A successful terminal substitutes for its private meter row, so
  no later report whose `before` snapshot contains that charge can precede the
  terminal in durable order. Failed submissions occupy a separate non-meter
  lane. A dirty open receipt is always selected before lane rotation, so every
  dependent mutation commits in the same transaction as, or a transaction
  after, the immutable token/open authority it names; a row/byte-limited open
  prefix remains the prerequisite on the next chunk until fully drained. Each
  scope also owns an
  independent event cursor, sink, revision, and flush generation. A rotating
  four-lane start order prevents sustained causal traffic from starving open,
  failed-terminal, or degradation receipts. Its first
  successful non-empty flush binds that scope to
  the ledger's opaque persisted `LedgerInstanceId`, revalidated against the
  live schema before every authority-bearing flush;
  aliases and moved handles remain the same sink, while a replacement file at
  the same path or independent memory ledger is refused before writes.
- `recover_open`, `recover_meter`, `recover_submission`, `recover_pressure`,
  `recover_pause_acknowledgement`, and `recover_resume_activation` rebuild one
  authenticated typed terminal at a time without dirtying a flush cursor.
  `Governor::new_durable` stores the ledger's private-field authenticated
  membership snapshot for its restart-stable governor namespace. The ledger
  obtains that snapshot by scanning the unfiltered union of both immutable
  claim indexes inside one stable read transaction, authenticating each
  compact copy before applying the governor filter, requiring cross-copy
  equality, and rooting the sorted authority bytes together with the physical
  ledger, governor, and count. Every filtered recovery probe likewise unions
  both indexes and authenticates the yielded authority, so single-table or
  concordant semantic corruption cannot lower the fence or hide Pending work.
  Until every observed authority has been installed by one of these typed
  recovery APIs, all fresh opens, charges, submissions, pressure actions,
  pause completions, and activations refuse with `DurableRecoveryIncomplete`.
  Reaching the expected cardinality is insufficient: fs-session recomputes the
  recovered `BTreeSet` root and requires exact membership; a wrong same-count
  set or excess member fails closed as bounded `Persistence` without mutation.
  Exact membership is hashed once when recovery first reaches the snapshot
  cardinality and cached as a private verified flag, so later mutation gates
  are O(1). While recovery is incomplete, each newly installed authority
  clears the flag until the exact root verifies and excess membership stays
  fenced. Once verified, duplicate and post-snapshot recovery marks are
  ignored: the snapshot names predecessor history only, so replaying a fresh
  claim created by this live governor cannot poison its completed fence. Empty
  history starts verified, while exact recovery and already-installed replay
  remain available. This governor-wide phase spans every session, scope, kind,
  and generation, so the global admission, meter-commit, and degradation
  counters are reconstructed before new work can reuse them. Open state is
  recovered first. Meter and successful-submission receipts must
  be installed in their contiguous global meter-commit order, but an
  authenticated terminal from an older gate generation remains recoverable
  after lifecycle recovery advances the current gate. Submission admission
  recovery may be out of order, but a bounded owner index rejects two distinct
  authorities for one ordinal and every decoded ordinal must be in
  `1..=i64::MAX`. New V7 submission claims always bind this ordinal. Reading a
  V6 submission claim with a NULL ordinal is retained only as defensive
  compatibility for the previously shipped table shape (which had no wired
  public registry writer): a Pending row remains indeterminate, while a
  terminal recovery takes the authenticated ordinal from its receipt.
  Degradation and pause
  terminals form one dense global event-ordinal prefix, so skipped or
  interleaved actions refuse before mutation. Before rotating a recovered
  pause, fs-session performs an indexed, bounded keyset-page ledger probe for
  any unterminated submission claim in the draining generation. The probe
  verifies every preceding terminal and all of its batch/event witnesses, is
  capped at 4,096 submission claims, and returns `IndeterminateMutation` when
  it finds Pending work; corrupt terminal presence fails closed. Exact cached
  acknowledgement/activation
  replay requires the current completed generation and exact process-local
  gate `Arc`, while a prior activation remains replayable after the next L3
  request asks that still-current gate to drain.
  Pause recovery takes the same typed receipt and re-verifies it against the
  reopened physical ledger before comparing terminal payload/receipt bytes.
- `write_program_risk_session_end_report(ledger, open_receipt, logical_time,
  observations)` evaluates fs-govern's distinct PR-001–PR-012 expansion-program
  register and automatically surfaces every non-green row in one owned
  `program-risk-report` event. The exact session open must already be persisted
  to the same physical sink, and the session must have no executing submission
  or pending pause acknowledgement at the sampled point. The caller owns the
  surrounding end-of-session coordination and ordinary scope flushes. One
  governor/session/open tuple has one
  opaque `ProgramRiskReportId`; exact report retry adds no artifact, operation,
  edge, terminal, witness, or event row, and any changed logical time or
  assessment conflicts. A valid schema-v8 report has no schema-v9 seal rows;
  its first replay or recovery atomically revalidates the complete historic
  lineage and installs whichever of the two immutable seals are missing. This
  bounded compatibility write is the only row addition permitted on such a
  retry. The receipt retains the
  report-time execution generation, so later pause/resume progress cannot
  rewrite the singleton's durable claim or make an exact retry structurally
  stale. A process-local singleton reservation prevents two callers sharing
  one live governor from creating duplicate lineage before terminal
  arbitration. The canonical register and
  session assessment are separate content-addressed artifacts rooted as input
  and output of one Five-Explicits lineage operation, so ledger GC retains both.
  Adoption verifies the exact seed, versions, byte budget, capability, logical
  timestamps, deterministic main-branch execution, successful no-diagnostic
  outcome, roles, and complete two-artifact edge set rather than trusting IR
  text alone. Verification uses fixed-size `LIMIT cap+1` ledger reads capped at
  one report producer and two role-qualified edges through covering lineage
  indexes; any truncation, second producer, third edge, missing edge, or role
  substitution fails closed before an unbounded lineage fan-out can be scanned,
  sorted, or materialized. Materialization also installs both the ledger's
  immutable exclusive output seal for the report artifact and its exact
  two-edge-set seal for the lineage operation in the same transaction as a
  newly-created op. Both unpublished-lineage adoption and schema-v8 lazy seal
  adoption validate the unsealed exact shape and install both seals in one
  transaction. Existing wrong-owner or wrong-count seals fail closed and are
  never replaced. Consequently, an arbitrary second ledger
  handle cannot add either a competing producer or a third lineage edge between
  verification and terminal commit or after publication; schema-attested edge
  triggers refuse both mutations. Replay and recovery revalidate both seals and
  their parent state with bounded covering-index probes.
  Artifact/lineage materialization precedes the atomic terminal/event batch: a
  crash in that seam can leave only reusable content-addressed artifacts and
  lineage, never a falsely terminal report. `recover_program_risk_report`
  validates the strict terminal codec, owned event, historic artifact kinds and
  content addresses, exact lineage envelope, and frozen v1 JSON semantics
  before satisfying the durable recovery fence. The stored register must have
  twelve ordered, complete rows; the report envelope and statuses must bind the
  terminal; and every embedded trigger must equal its stored-register trigger.
  A report generation ahead of reconstructed pause/resume lifecycle state is
  refused. Recovery deliberately accepts the exact stored historical register;
  later canonical register revisions do not brick an already-durable report.
- Deterministic hard caps bound retained governor state and public
  materialization: 4,096 sessions/governor, 1,024 sessions/scope, 4,096
  submission keys/session, 8,192 meter reports/session, 4,096 pressure
  actions/session, 65,536 degradation events/scope, 16 KiB evidence
  previews, 64 MiB of retained caller-controlled payload/scope, 256 MiB of
  retained caller-controlled payload/governor, 1,024 event-page and flush rows,
  4 MiB flush bytes, and checked signed-ledger ordinals. Counts bound fixed
  structure overhead; byte budgets conservatively count duplicated key strings,
  token text, event attribution/evidence, and terminal reservations. Limit+1
  refuses before partial mutation.
- `gemm_f64_session_with_pool(tuner, cache_policy, pool, gate, m, n, k, α,
  a, b, β, c)`
  — the production GEMM autotune loop (bead yqug): measure → cache →
  model → cancellation-correct dispatch through one caller-owned, reusable
  `TilePool`. `gemm_f64_session(..., threads, ...)` is the compatibility
  wrapper that constructs an unpinned host pool. The `*_budgeted` forms accept
  an explicit `GemmMemoryEnvelope`; legacy wrappers pass the explicit unbounded
  sentinel. The scoped key binds fs-la's bit semantics version, power-of-two
  shape class, requested/normalized thread budget, memory limit, exact capped
  probe dims (M/K ≤ 512, N ≤ 2048), resolved SIMD tier,
  the executing pool's canonical topology/mode/weights/arena/pin-groups
  identity, implementation version, and generated compiler/profile/codegen
  build fingerprint, plus `GEMM_TUNER_SCHEMA_VERSION`, which must bump whenever
  the producer lattice, probe/sample policy, ranking, or plan mapping changes;
  the ledger key also binds the machine fingerprint.
  `gemm_tune_build_evidence()` exposes that exact build fingerprint together
  with `GemmGraphEvidenceClass`, the fingerprint-bound class identity, and the
  optional full canonical dependency receipt + domain digest. This lets root
  orchestration require and retain the receipt artifact before publication.
  `GEMM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT_DOMAIN` is re-exported so the root can recompute the
  digest from retained bytes without copying a private domain string.
  `OperatorObservedReceipt` means strict receipt structure was validated, not
  that fs-session independently authenticated the operator or reconstructed
  Cargo's invocation-exact unit graph. `DevelopmentEquivalenceSalt` is never
  verified graph evidence.
  Shape/overflow and
  pre-requested-cancel checks happen before any tune mutation; one-thread,
  small-M, and no-product calls bypass tuning. Pinned plans skip measurement;
  else an exact tuner/ledger row is used; else an up-to-4×2 lattice is
  deduplicated by the `(mc,nc)` values fs-la will actually execute and sampled
  three times. Probe A, B, candidate C, and the exact-bit reference are
  fallibly reserved and jointly charged to the session envelope; bounded sweeps
  pass only the remaining child ceiling to fs-la. Every output word from every
  repeat is compared by `f64::to_bits`
  (signed zero and NaN payloads included); drift fails closed. The declared
  model is argmin of minimum wall time with lattice-order tie breaking, not a
  confidence claim. `GemmTuneCache` makes durable access explicit:
  `Disabled`, `ReadOnly`, or `ReadWrite`. Read-only callers may adopt an
  existing validated row but cannot publish during speculative work. A newly
  measured row is sealed as `ValidatedGemmTuneRow` inside `GemmDispatch`; its
  private fields cannot be forged or altered. `receipt_json()` is its canonical
  kernel/shape/machine/params/measured/memory-limit/probe-buffer-plan preimage;
  a public globally unique
  derive-key domain hashes those exact bytes, and
  `admit_receipt_json(domain, version, bytes)` is the strict retained-replay
  boundary. It accepts only the current v2 domain/version, parses the exact
  whitespace-free outer JSON, semantically re-adopts the embedded fs-exec
  `TuneRow`, and cross-checks its kernel, shape class, machine, and selected
  params against the duplicated outer values. It also requires the current
  metadata-plan schema and byte total, reconstructs the private tuple, and then
  requires a byte-identical writer/parser fixed point. This adds replay admission without
  rotating the already-shipped v2 preimage bytes. Stale metadata, reordered
  fields, noncanonical machine width, malformed nested JSON, or trailing bytes
  refuse rather than being guessed into the current schema.
  `publish_to_ledger` participates in an already-open wider transaction.
  Cache adoption returns the same sealed identity on its first dispatch so
  downstream evidence can bind adopted and freshly measured rows uniformly.
  `publish_if_absent_or_identical` lets evidence populate an independent ledger
  but refuses to overwrite a different row already stored under that key.
  `replace_cache_row` is the distinct mutable-cache operation: only a sealed,
  remeasured row can replace stale or malformed dispatch state, and exact
  read-back is required. Replacement is never authority inherited by a delayed
  or cloned benchmark receipt. Read-write mode uses that repair path and
  durably writes the same sealed row before committing it locally. A decision is recorded
  only after fs-la drains and successfully commits the staged output.
  `GemmDispatch.run` carries the final compute counts and every real per-panel
  fs-exec `RunReport`; `execution_receipt()` projects kernel, mode, deterministic
  declared panel ordinal, completed/total counts, and the deterministic memory
  plan into `GemmExecutionReceipt`, explicitly excluding steal, latency,
  worker-distribution, peak-use, and refusal measurements from replay identity.
  `GemmExecutionReceipt::canonical_bytes()` is the canonical v1 transport: a
  domain/version-bearing tagged binary frame with fixed-width little-endian
  integers, explicit UTF-8 byte lengths, an explicit panel count, and retained
  panel order. `from_canonical_bytes()` is bounded (64 MiB, 1,048,576 panels,
  64 KiB/string), requires every tag in schema order, rejects stale versions
  and trailing bytes, and proves a byte-identical fixed point before admission;
  `receipt_identity()` hashes exactly that frame under the v1 derive-key
  domain. Every top-level, nested memory, and nested panel field is semantic.
  Collection length and order are semantic. Schedule observations excluded
  above remain available only in the full run report and cannot silently enter
  this replay identity.
  `GemmDispatch.kernel` is the exact replay key; replay pins the recorded key
  and params rather than reconstructing a weaker base key.

## Invariants

1. **Enforcement is structured**: every over-grant outcome is `Throttled`
   or `Paused` with resource, used, granted, and a resume hint — no kill
   path exists in the API.
2. **Exactly-once within the owning session and scope**: for any typed
   process-local submission request, `work` runs at most once; all callers in that scope
   observe either non-blocking `InFlight` or the same terminal content-derived
   receipt, and consumption is charged exactly once (16-thread and reentrant
   race-tested). The receipt binds the immutable ledger scope. The same caller
   key in another session is independent and produces a different receipt, so
   one tenant cannot suppress another tenant's work. Reusing a caller-key
   identity with a different canonical request conflicts rather than returning
   stale work. Durable execution additionally requires a fresh immutable
   pre-execution claim; recovered Pending never runs work, while recovered
   terminal replay changes no meter, counter, reservation, gate, cursor, or
   ledger row.
3. **The ladder order is the contract**: spill before coarsen before pause,
   always; pause requests one gate generation, reserves its completion event,
   exact opaque acknowledgement rotates to a fresh gate, and explicit
   activation precedes the next pressure transition. Rotation is refused until
   every admitted submission in the draining generation has published its
   terminal meter outcome. Identical acknowledgement
   replay is idempotent while that completion is latest; a requested
   never-activated resume gate is recoverable by same-generation replay without
   another ledger event, and the replaced acknowledgement cannot activate.
   Activation replay is idempotent while its gate generation remains current,
   including after the next pause requests that gate. Completion additionally
   requires a ledger-verified solver-state artifact whose run matches a
   nonempty executor report minted only after all registered old-worker guards
   drained. `SolverState` snapshots round-trip losslessly across repeated
   pause-resume cycles.
4. **Estimates state their coverage**: unmodeled ops are listed, their
   wall is excluded, nothing is silently assumed.
5. **Meters are exact and replay-safe under storm**: concurrent distinct
   reports accumulate without loss; concurrent identical reports return one
   receipt and commit exactly once. Commit-ordered pre/post snapshots form a
   causal chain independent of scheduling-dependent submission admission.
6. **Every live-process owned idempotency execution terminates**: success or caller panic
   transitions `Pending` exactly once and carries one shared terminal receipt;
   failed work never charges and same-key retry never executes implicitly.
   Successful receipts bind bit-exact charge fields, admission order, causal
   meter receipt, and enforcement verdict; duplicates replay that verdict and
   meter receipt without recharging. A process death can leave a durable claim
   Pending; that state is explicitly indeterminate and is never silently
   terminalized or rerun.
7. **Invalid resources fail closed**: NaN, infinities, negative values, and
   accumulated floating-point overflow are rejected before any token or meter
   mutation. Landing exactly on a grant returns `Throttled`.
8. **GEMM tuning cannot create phantom success**: malformed shapes and
   no-op/serial routes cannot create rows or decisions; cancellation or bit
   drift during measurement cannot create a row; cache failure, foreign
   execution identity, and params/body disagreement cannot install a row.
   Read-only mode performs no ledger writes and exports only an unforgeable
   validated row. In read-write mode, ledger persistence precedes local row
   commit; successful compute precedes decision commit. Cancellation during
   final dispatch may retain its already validated measured row, but records no
   successful decision and leaves caller `C` bitwise intact.
9. **Session identity is immutable and retryable**: exact same
   `SessionOpenId`/token/gate replays the original receipt and permit. A
   different open authority for an existing `SessionId` is a structured
   `SessionAlreadyOpen` refusal. The original capability, meter, cancellation
   gate, pause state, and terminal generations remain unchanged.
10. **Scoped flush is semantic-once and retryable**: one open receipt,
    standalone causal meter report, terminal submission generation, or
    degradation terminal group is appended at most once to the sink bound by
    its token's exact ledger scope, even if the database committed before the
    live cursor advanced. Interleaved
    scopes have independent sink, generation, and degradation cursors. One
    scope's atomic success advances only its cursors; wrong-sink,
    foreign-permit, in-flight refusal, or persistence failure advances none,
    while successful unchanged repeats verify the immutable batch and append
    zero rows. Each bounded chunk
    commits only its prepared cursors and reports whether another chunk or
    concurrently-created state remains dirty.
11. **All retained collections are bounded**: session, scope-session,
    operator-authority, submission-key, meter-report, pressure-action,
    degradation-event plus reserved
    completion row/ordinal, fixed checkpoint-receipt evidence,
    per-scope/per-governor retained payload, pagination, flush row/byte, and
    ordinal limits are checked
    before their corresponding state transition. Limit refusal never runs
    caller work or partially advances a cursor, gate, meter, event stream, or
    authority binding.
12. **Program-risk surfacing is singleton and fail-closed**: one drained,
    sink-bound session snapshot owns one typed terminal and alert-summary event.
    Missing, duplicate, malformed, or tripped evidence remains visible as an
    alert; exact retry adds no artifact, operation, edge, terminal, witness, or
    event row even after the live session advances to a later gate generation.
    The first schema-v9 replay or recovery of a valid schema-v8 report may add
    only its missing immutable output and exact-edge-set seals; changed retry
    cannot replace the original report.
13. **Long-job resume semantics are exact**: request identity changes when any
    job, budget, program, model, catalog, or resume-descriptor field changes.
    A resume tuple absent from or mismatched against the supplied pinned catalog
    refuses rather than falling back to a nearby version. Digest-only rows and
    canonical resume payload bounds larger than the whole-job memory request
    also refuse. Membership of another otherwise-valid row does not establish
    owner, model, or job-kind compatibility.

## Error model

`SessionError`: `UnknownSession`, `SessionNotQuiescent`, `SessionAlreadyOpen`,
`MutationAuthorityMismatch`, `MutationConflict`, `StaleMutationGeneration`,
`InvalidLedgerScope`,
`InvalidOperatorGrant`, `DuplicateOperatorGrant`,
`UnknownLedgerScope`, `LedgerScopeSinkMismatch`, `ScopePermitMismatch`,
`ScopeFlushInFlight`, `LimitExceeded`, `InvalidPressureLevel`,
`UngatedSession`, `PauseAlreadyPending`, `PauseDrainPending`,
`SessionGateDraining`,
`PreRequestedGate`, `PauseRequestMismatch`, `PauseAcknowledgementConflict`,
`ResumeNotActivated`, `ResumeAcknowledgementMismatch`,
`ResumeGateAlreadyRequested`, `InvalidResource`, `Submission`, `Persistence`,
`DurableLedgerRequired`, `RecoveryRequired`, `DurableRecoveryIncomplete`,
`IndeterminateMutation`, `TerminalCorrupt`,
`UnsupportedTerminalSchema`, `RecoveryLedgerMismatch`,
`RecoveryGovernorMismatch`, and `RecoveryCausalGap`.
`GemmTuneError`: cancellation with
the drained numerical report when dispatch began, structured TilePool failure
with tile provenance and its full report, typed tuner refusal, ledger refusal,
exact-bit drift with candidate and repeat, `MemoryRefused` with the outer
session peak plus any fs-la report, or `MemoryPlanOverflow` before unsafe
allocation. Cancellation observed before or between numerical dispatches has
no fs-la report but still retains the outer session peak; cancellation returned
by fs-la and every executor/memory refusal preserve the full drained report.
All such paths leave caller-visible `C` unchanged. Refusals that teach travel
as `Guidance` values with ranked fixes.
A caller-work panic is data, not an unwind across the governor API:
`SubmitOutcome::Failed` records its receipt and bounded retained evidence.
`LongJobRequestError` separately reports bounded invalid fields/resources,
catalog-byte/pin mismatch, exact catalog lookup failures, digest-only resume
transport, and resume payload bounds that exceed the whole-job memory request.
Catalog and transport refusals retain the exact catalog, model, state-schema,
resume-family, wire-schema, and descriptor identities for forensic diagnosis.
These refusals do not mutate governor or ledger state.

## Determinism class

Governor state transitions are deterministic given the commit order; event,
submission-admission, and meter-commit ordinals are logical (no wall clocks in
ledgered payloads). Concurrency admission/completion order is
scheduling-dependent, but enforcement is authoritative and re-earnable from
commit-ordered meter pre/post receipts. GEMM numerical bits are
independent of the selected MC/NC plan; the wall-clock winner is inherently
environment-dependent and therefore travels as scoped evidence plus an exact
replayable decision. Program-risk reports use the caller's explicit logical
time; register order, assessment order, JSON bytes, content addresses, alert
order, and retry identity are otherwise deterministic.

## Cancellation behavior

The governor is itself a cancellation SOURCE (pause step → CancelGate).
Its own operations are short, bounded critical sections. GEMM sweep and final
dispatch use the same caller-owned pool and poll the same gate inside bounded
packing/microtile work. fs-la stages `C`, stops claiming M-band tiles, drains
all workers and Cx arenas, and commits only after the final poll; cancellation
returns compute plus TilePool progress and leaves caller `C` bit-for-bit
unchanged. The pool's worker lifetime is not yet an asupersync child scope; the
precise no-claim and follow-up live in fs-exec's L0 contract.

## Unsafe boundary

Zero `unsafe`.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs` (JSON verdicts, suite `fs-session/conformance`):
ss-001 token→admission bridge end-to-end; ss-002 Ok→Throttled→Paused
with exact meters and structured unknown-session errors; ss-003
16-thread idempotency race (one execution, one charge, non-blocking in-flight
observations or shared terminal receipt, plus same-thread reentrancy and
independent keys); ss-004 estimate p10/p50/p90 + energy + declared mem +
honest coverage, calibration ratio quantiles, ledgered artifact
round-trip; ss-004b invalid estimator/calibration numeric domains fail closed
without poisoning JSON; ss-004c caller-key substitution of a foreign sealed
operation scope refuses before pricing; ss-005 ladder order + gate request + toy-SolverState
snapshot equality + attributed ordinal-ordered events; ss-006 the
canonical BudgetInfeasible finding surfacing as ranked `Guidance`;
ss-007 32-way adversarial-grant storm with exact meters and structured
outcomes only; ss-008 seeded caller panic with eight concurrent duplicates
returning `InFlight`, bounded full-digest evidence, one terminal failure
receipt, and zero charge; ss-009 NaN/infinite/negative grant and charge refusal
with no-mutation checks;
ss-010 the exact-grant throttle boundary and atomic accumulated-overflow
refusal; ss-002b duplicate session registration preserving the original token,
meters, gate, and terminal idempotency state; ss-003d atomic incremental ledger
flush, unchanged-call no-op behavior, and dirty-cursor retry after transaction
refusal; ss-003e canonical scope validation plus foreign-permit and page-bound
refusals; ss-003f two-scope interleaving, independent sink binding, exact scoped
payload escaping, cross-scope wrong-sink refusal, and per-scope cursor retry.
ss-003g proves moved handles retain opaque sink identity while independent
ledgers differ; ss-003h drains a limit+1 batch through bounded atomic chunks;
ss-003m/n/o/p cover gated and ungated open/meter response loss, concurrent
open/report replay,
exact payload conflicts and foreign authority, pressure replay across
pending/ready/activated phases plus stale unused generation, same caller
key/different program conflict, and barrier-controlled inverted submission
completion whose meter receipts preserve the required `B=Ok`, `A=Throttled`
causal sequence and flush exactly once. ss-003o persists that inversion to a
real file, refuses foreign session/scope recovery, then reopens and proves the
meter-completion order must be recovered before admission order; exact client
replay invokes no work and changes no registry, witness, meter, or audit row.
The pause-drain regression proves a
pending submission must meter and terminalize before acknowledgement can rotate
its gate generation, new work is refused throughout draining/ready phases, and
exact terminal replay remains available during both;
ss-011 covers pending/ready pressure refusal, cross-governor request authority,
old-worker finalization refusal, malformed receipt transport, cross-session and
foreign-ledger refusal, stored-receipt response-loss replay, same-generation
replacement of an externally requested never-activated gate, stale-
acknowledgement refusal, conflicting evidence refusal, explicit idempotent
activation, and repeated generations; ss-012
covers exact session/scope/key boundaries and atomic limit+1 refusal. In-module
tests cover exact flush row/byte limits, event/ordinal/retained-byte caps,
concurrent acknowledgement replay, altered-acknowledgement refusal, multiple
simultaneous reservations,
pagination, and same-scope in-flight reservation refusal.
`maximum_page_and_flush_materialize_without_holding_the_governor_lock`
barrier-pauses a 1,024-row evidence page and a 1,024-terminal flush after
snapshot capture, then proves an unrelated scope can complete both charge and
submit before either materializer is released.
The durable registry regressions use real on-disk ledger reopen: a fresh
Pending claim executes no closure and rolls back every local reservation;
successful and failed submission terminals recover their original receipt;
altered program reuse conflicts; a restored pre-commit cursor snapshot
replays the exact batch without adding a terminal, membership, or audit row;
and a three-event terminal group is never split at the row boundary. In-module
restart-fence regressions additionally prove empty, exact, duplicate, wrong,
and excess predecessor membership plus the post-snapshot case where
`submit_once_durable` replays a newly durable open without poisoning the
already-verified fence or blocking a later mutation.

`tests/program_risk.rs` covers a quantitative PR-001 trip automatically
surfacing in the receipt, report artifact, typed terminal, and one owned event;
register/report lineage and GC retention; zero-row exact replay; atomic changed
retry conflict; unflushed, foreign-receipt, and wrong-sink refusal; and a real
durable reopen in which fresh report replay remains fenced until typed report
recovery restores the historic artifacts without row drift. A lifecycle
regression advances through pause acknowledgement and resume after publication,
then proves replay still uses the report's original generation and adds no row;
a durable generation-one report refuses recovery until that pause,
acknowledgement, and activation have themselves been reconstructed.
In-module G0/G3 tests freeze the v1 positional row order, status-byte/code
mapping, codec offsets, historic register/report decoder, process-local
singleton reservation, and populated schema-v8-style terminal replay/recovery
whose first schema-v9 verification adds only the two missing seal rows.

`tests/long_job.rs` is the G0 identity/refusal battery. It independently
reconstructs the complete tagged little-endian v1 preimage, proves every
request dimension moves identity, separates hybrid-machine and theorem-check
jobs, rejects malformed names and zero numeric/hash domains, and refuses
self-consistent substituted catalog bytes against a retained expected pin,
catalog-absent families/versions, descriptor mismatch, digest-only transport,
and resume payload bounds larger than the whole-job memory request. In-module
tests lock both job-kind tags, mutate the private catalog and resume fields one
at a time, and prove identity version/domain rotation and transport-version/
length guards fail closed.

`tests/gemm_tune.rs` (bead yqug drills): cold start sweeps once and
matches serial bits; ledger warm start seeds a fresh session without
re-measuring; stale (foreign-fingerprint) and invalid cache rows are
refused and re-measured; a requested gate cancels the sweep with no row
and untouched output; pre-requested warm and pinned paths leave output and
decision logs untouched; non-canonical/off-lattice/mis-keyed pins are
structured refusals; replay uses the actual recorded scoped decision and
reproduces the live bits; execution identity separates thread budgets and
exact probes even inside one shape bucket; serial/no-op/small and invalid-shape
paths cannot mutate tuning state; every lattice plan matches serial bits.
An n=640 producer test executes both the two-panel NC=512 route and the
single-panel wider route, proving the NC axis reaches fs-la rather than only
changing evidence labels. Caller-pool drills prove the same pool executes
measurement and final dispatch, the receipt contains real TilePool traversal,
legacy std-thread placement keys are refused, and pinned/unpinned placement
policies cannot share tune rows.
In-module injected Gauntlet tests force exact signed-zero/NaN-payload drift in
each repeat, candidate collapse, between-repeat cancellation, cache-write
failure/retry, params/body disagreement, wrong-probe adoption, and cancelled
dispatch without a success decision. The oracle lane
(`--ignored`, release) asserts the live choice is within the declared
25% tolerance of the exhaustive best-of-3 oracle at the real problem
size and reports its machine — measured 1.000/1.000/1.062 on
macos-aarch64 under ambient load; the second-ISA (x86) counterpart is
armed and runs when an x86 host picks it up.

## No-claim boundaries

- **The governor meters what it is TOLD** (`Charge` deltas from the
  executor); OS-level resource sampling and per-thread accounting are
  the executor/observability beads' territory.
- **Degradation steps are orchestration events**: actual arena spilling and
  adaptive coarsening are fs-alloc/solver behaviors triggered by these events,
  not implemented here. Their v5 phase is therefore `declared`, never
  `applied`. Pause completion now requires independently verified ledger and
  executor receipts. Its precise no-claim boundary is enrollment: the opaque
  drain report proves every worker registered with that `DrainTracker` released
  its guard, but fs-session cannot discover an orchestrator-owned thread that
  was never registered. Nor does generic envelope validation prove that a
  solver-specific payload is semantically sufficient or scientifically
  correct; those claims remain with the solver contract and Gauntlet evidence.
- **Capability issuance is not authenticated yet**: `CapabilityToken` and the
  fs-ir projection are caller-constructible declarations. Registration makes a
  declaration immutable inside one governor, but does not prove an external
  issuer, entitlement, expiry/revocation policy, dynamic operator binding, or a
  shared concurrent-core lease. This authority boundary is tracked by
  `frankensim-authenticate-session-capability-issuance-aeq7`.
- **A `LongJobRequest` is not admission or execution authority**: construction
  does not authenticate a `SessionGrant`, reserve any budget or core lease,
  inspect a live cancellation gate, run or resume work, decode owner checkpoint
  bytes, prove bit-identical cancelled-versus-uninterrupted trajectories,
  establish theorem truth, or establish physical correctness. A catalog row's
  membership does not prove that its state semantics are compatible with the
  declared job kind, model, or owner, and the caller-supplied expected catalog
  pin is not authenticated here. Those claims require the later governor
  integration, owner-specific replay adapter, and G4 trajectory evidence.
- **Recovered Pending execution remains indeterminate by design**: the durable
  claim proves only that the one authorized caller may have started arbitrary
  `FnOnce` work. fs-session cannot infer or compensate external side effects,
  so it returns `IndeterminateMutation` and requires an explicit reconciliation
  decision. Terminal mutation replay, immutable event ownership, gate-state
  reconstruction, and commit-before-cursor append-once are claimed here;
  study-scale kill storms and application-specific side-effect reconciliation
  remain gp3.11 responsibilities.
- **One active governor owns a durable nonce at a time**: restart recovery is
  proven for a predecessor that has stopped. Claim uniqueness and reciprocal
  submission/pause checks reject already-visible stale state, but they are not
  a renewable process lease and simultaneous transactions from two live
  `Governor::new_durable` instances using the same nonce are not claimed safe.
  General split-brain ownership and takeover are gp3.11 orchestration work.
- **Energy is a declared-constant model** (45 W/core), not measured
  power telemetry; the calibration channel is where reality lands.
- **Terminal durability still follows explicit scope flush**: the
  pre-execution submission claim is committed before work, but its success or
  failure receipt becomes restart-replayable only when
  `flush_scope_to_ledger` commits the typed terminal and owned event. A crash
  in between is safely Pending/indeterminate, not a claimed recovered result.
- **Flush snapshots shorten but do not eliminate governor serialization**:
  `Arc` snapshots remove evidence cloning and terminal encoding from the
  governor-wide critical section; scope validation, bounded source selection,
  reservation, and cursor commit still serialize briefly on that mutex. The
  barrier regression proves lock independence, not a hardware-specific
  wall-clock latency SLO.
- **Each exact ledger scope flushes to one owning sink**: per-scope in-memory
  cursors prevent duplicate appends, while a later different sink for that
  scope is refused by opaque `LedgerInstanceId` before writes rather than
  receiving a partial history. Paths are not sink identity.
  Different scopes can bind independent sinks. Cross-ledger replication of one
  scope remains an event-log concern above this API.
- **A program-risk report is a session-end snapshot, not session closure**:
  fs-session has no terminal session lifecycle state here. The report requires
  current point-in-time quiescence but does not reserve the scope, flush already
  completed ordinary mutations, revoke the capability token, or prove that an
  orchestrator will never admit later work. An exact replay attempted during
  later in-flight work refuses until the caller drains again. The caller must
  establish and order the wider session-end boundary. The event surfaces
  governance status; it does not execute a mitigation/contingency or
  authenticate the observation producer.
- **Program-risk artifact and terminal publication are a documented two-phase
  seam**: fs-ledger does not currently combine content-addressed artifact writes,
  lineage creation, and session-terminal publication in one transaction. A
  crash may retain rooted artifacts without the terminal; retry deterministically
  reuses them. Consumers must treat only the typed terminal/event receipt as a
  published session snapshot.
- **Schema-v8 program-risk lineage is sealed lazily, not by migration-time
  inference**: schema v9 creates empty seal tables because the ledger layer
  cannot infer which historic consumers claimed exclusive provenance. The
  first PPVS replay or recovery revalidates the exact bounded lineage inside a
  transaction and installs its missing seals. Until that consumer verification
  succeeds, a migrated report remains unsealed and is not accepted as
  replayable/recoverable by fs-session.
- **Two-lane executor integration** (interactive vs batch lanes with
  core quotas) is deferred to gp3.11's study-scale batteries; the
  enforcement/idempotency/estimate surfaces here are what it composes.
- fs-session exposes fs-la's exact dependency receipt and trust class but does
  not upgrade it: correspondence between an operator-supplied receipt and the
  invoking Cargo build remains operator-trusted. Root publication from a
  development-salt build is not claimed as receipt-backed evidence.
- Tune-row receipt admission proves the current v2 identity framing and exact
  retained bytes. It semantically re-adopts the embedded fs-exec `TuneRow` and
  cross-checks every duplicated key field, but returns only the outer
  domain-separated identity; it does not turn replay bytes into a live
  `ValidatedGemmTuneRow`. Live publication and dispatch authority still
  require the private `PreparedGemmRow` validation path.
- Execution-receipt canonicalization proves complete field binding and exact
  transport, not that caller-constructed public receipt values came from a
  successful kernel. `is_complete()` and the enclosing producer/evidence gate
  remain separate admission requirements.
- A mutex self-deadlock in the calibration renderer was found by the
  conformance run and fixed (single lock scope). That renderer remains
  non-reentrant; governor idempotency separately guarantees that same-thread
  duplicate submission returns `InFlight` rather than deadlocking.
- GEMM minimum-wall-time ranking is a deterministic selection rule over the
  recorded samples, not statistical confidence. The x86 oracle lane remains
  armed rather than claimed as measured until it runs on the reference host.
- The session envelope covers the four dominant numeric tune buffers, every
  fs-la-owned dispatch reservation, AND the session tune-metadata plan (bead
  wf9.15.1): candidate/ranking/observation collections (BTreeSet dedup was
  replaced by a bounded linear scan — tree-node overhead is not honestly
  accountable), one reused sample buffer plus per-observation exact copies,
  canonical plan labels, and the sealed-row strings, all with documented
  caps ENFORCED at observation/seal time. `run_sweep` charges the plan
  constant after the probe buffers clear the envelope alone (refusal
  `what: "tune-metadata-plan"`, before any allocation, never losing a
  validated fs-la report) and the child envelope excludes probe + plan
  bytes. The plan is a pure constant of the sweep lattice and schema caps —
  `gemm_tune_metadata_plan_bytes()` / `GEMM_TUNE_METADATA_PLAN_SCHEMA` — and
  every sealed row binds it into `receipt_json` as `metadata_plan`, so a
  freshly measured row and the same row adopted later derive the identical
  `receipt_identity`. Introducing the field rotates pre-plan row identities
  once (stored ledger cache rows re-tune on first touch — the same rotation
  class as a build-fingerprint change). Generic TilePool metadata remains
  the separate `frankensim-epic-substrate-wf9.16` boundary.

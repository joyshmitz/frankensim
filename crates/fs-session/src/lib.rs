//! fs-session (plan §11.3): sessions, capability tokens, and the resource
//! GOVERNOR — budgets are ENFORCED, not advisory — plus the agent-proofing
//! trio: idempotency keys (a retry cannot double-spend), `estimate()` dry
//! runs (plan before you spend), and errors as GUIDANCE ("a refusal that
//! teaches is worth ten silent successes").
//! Quiescent session snapshots can also persist and automatically surface the
//! expansion program's quantitative PR-001--PR-012 register through
//! [`program_risk`].
//!
//! Layer: L6 (HELM). Threading contract: the governor's hot paths are
//! `Send + Sync` (in-memory, mutex-guarded) so enforcement and idempotency
//! survive concurrent submission storms; ledger persistence is an explicit
//! single-threaded `flush_scope_to_ledger` step because fsqlite connections are
//! `!Send` by design.

//! The production GEMM autotune loop (bead yqug): measure → cache →
//! model → dispatch, closed end-to-end.
//!
//! [`gemm_f64_session`] is the production consumer the tuner was built
//! for: it resolves an MC/NC [`GemmBlockPlan`] for the caller's shape
//! class (pins beat cached rows beat the documented cold-start default),
//! runs a BOUNDED candidate sweep when the machine is cold, records the
//! ranked wall-time evidence as a tune row, applies the caller's explicit
//! cache policy, and dispatches
//! `fs_la::gemm_f64_parallel_with_pool` with the selected plan.
//!
//! Honesty boundaries, in the fs-exec tuner's division:
//! - The KERNEL KEY embeds fs-la's `GEMM_BIT_SEMANTICS_VERSION`, so rows
//!   measured under a different accumulation contract can never match a
//!   lookup (semantic filtering by construction). Rows are additionally
//!   bound to the exact probe dims, requested/normalized thread budget,
//!   resolved ISA tier, placement policy, and implementation version, then
//!   the exact compiler/profile/codegen build fingerprint, then machine-
//!   fingerprint-keyed. The ledger read path refuses stale,
//!   differently scoped, non-canonical, and params/body-disagreeing rows.
//! - MC/NC are BIT-NEUTRAL by fs-la's determinism contract, and the
//!   sweep ENFORCES that: every repeat of every effective candidate is
//!   compared word-for-word with the first output, else the loop fails
//!   closed with [`GemmTuneError::BitDrift`] and records nothing. KC is part
//!   of the bit contract and is NOT in this loop. The resolved SIMD tier is
//!   bit-neutral but remains performance identity.
//! - The "cost model" is declared and minimal: argmin of the per-
//!   candidate MINIMUM wall time, ties to the earlier candidate in
//!   lattice order — a recorded selection rule, never a statistical
//!   confidence claim.
//!
//! Determinism class: dispatch results are bit-identical to serial
//! `gemm_f64` for every plan the loop can select (enforced by the sweep
//! and gated in tests); WHICH plan wins is wall-clock-dependent by
//! nature and travels as evidence + a pinnable decision, never inside
//! numeric results.

//! The production GEMM autotune loop (bead yqug): measure → cache →
//! model → dispatch, closed end-to-end.
//!
//! [`gemm_f64_session`] is the production consumer the tuner was built
//! for: it resolves an MC/NC [`GemmBlockPlan`] for the caller's shape
//! class (pins beat cached rows beat the documented cold-start default),
//! runs a BOUNDED candidate sweep when the machine is cold, records the
//! ranked wall-time evidence as a tune row, writes it through to the
//! ledger `tune` table, and dispatches `fs_la::gemm_f64_parallel_with`
//! with the selected plan.
//!
//! Honesty boundaries, in the fs-exec tuner's division:
//! - The KERNEL KEY embeds fs-la's `GEMM_BIT_SEMANTICS_VERSION`, so rows
//!   measured under a different accumulation contract can never match a
//!   lookup (semantic filtering by construction). Rows are additionally
//!   machine-fingerprint-keyed; the ledger read path refuses stale
//!   (other-machine) and non-canonical rows instead of adopting them.
//! - MC/NC are BIT-NEUTRAL by fs-la's determinism contract, and the
//!   sweep ENFORCES that: every candidate's output must be bitwise
//!   identical to the first candidate's, else the loop fails closed
//!   with [`GemmTuneError::BitDrift`] and records nothing. KC and the
//!   SIMD tier are part of the bit contract and are NOT in this loop.
//! - The "cost model" is declared and minimal: argmin of the per-
//!   candidate MINIMUM wall time, ties to the earlier candidate in
//!   lattice order — a recorded selection rule, never a statistical
//!   confidence claim.
//!
//! Determinism class: dispatch results are bit-identical to serial
//! `gemm_f64` for every plan the loop can select (enforced by the sweep
//! and gated in tests); WHICH plan wins is wall-clock-dependent by
//! nature and travels as evidence + a pinnable decision, never inside
//! numeric results.

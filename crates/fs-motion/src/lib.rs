//! fs-motion — certified rigid motion for the MORPH layer.
//!
//! `fs-ga` owns instantaneous SE(3) motor algebra; nothing previously
//! bound a motor PATH to a chart. This crate provides
//! [`CertifiedMotorTube`] (piecewise Taylor-model enclosures of the
//! motor components with rigorously measured versor-defect bounds),
//! [`MotorPath`] (the point-evaluation view), [`SpacetimeChart`]
//! (moving geometry with frozen-time snapshots and certified
//! time-span field enclosures), [`SweptChart`] (certified implicit
//! infimum bounds), fail-closed [`EnvelopeChart`] characteristic
//! classification, analytic screw and Wankel-pose constructors, and
//! two-sided clearance and closed-chamber volume receipts, plus
//! the [`LowerToMotorTube`] builder contract that lets higher layers
//! lower their motions here without upward dependencies.
//!
//! See `CONTRACT.md` for invariants, determinism class, and no-claim
//! boundaries. Beads: `frankensim-ext-motion-motor-tube-c70j` and
//! `frankensim-ext-motion-swept-envelope-c58q`.

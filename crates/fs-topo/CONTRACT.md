# fs-topo — CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

L2 (MORPH). Validity and topology certificates (plan §7.8): three
certificate families, none of them sampling heuristics — manifoldness
with defect LOCALIZATION, self-intersection freedom as an EXACT PROOF,
and cubical topology (exact Betti numbers, true 0-dimensional
persistence) as the topology oracle ASCENT's castability/routing
constraints will consume.

## Public types and semantics

- `manifold_certificate(soup, interior_probe)` → `ManifoldReport`:
  combinatorial checks (edge-use census with direction bookkeeping,
  half-edge round-trip with the builder's vertex-link teaching
  errors) plus geometric red flags (degenerate faces, fold-overs) and
  the outward-orientation winding probe. Every defect is a typed,
  LOCALIZED `ManifoldDefect`; `certified()` ⟺ zero defects.
- `self_intersection_certificate(soup)` → `SelfIntersectReport`:
  sweep-and-prune broad phase; EXACT narrow phase — plane-separation
  early exits, then exact edge-vs-triangle tests (four `orient3d`
  signs each; complete for non-coplanar pairs because every
  intersection-segment endpoint lies on some edge), exact `orient2d`
  for the coplanar case. Faces sharing a vertex are adjacency-excused.
  A PASS is a PROOF (exact arithmetic — false PASS impossible); exact
  contact reports the conservative `Touching` kind (the bounded,
  LISTED false-FAIL class the acceptance contract allows).
- `cubical::voxelize` / `betti` / `persistence0` /
  `count_persistent` / `verify_topology`:
  - `betti`: exact Betti triple of the voxel solid — `b0` by
    6-connected union-find, `b2` as bounded complement components
    against a virtual outside, `b1 = b0 + b2 − χ` with χ counted
    EXACTLY on the closed cubical complex (a k-cell is present iff an
    incident voxel is filled);
  - `persistence0`: true 0-dimensional persistence of the sublevel
    filtration — elder rule at every merge, essential classes kept,
    deterministic (voxels sorted by value then index);
  - `verify_topology`: chart-level Betti at resolution `n`, HONESTLY
    framed — exact for the voxel solid, Estimate-grade for the chart
    (sub-cell features can be missed).

## Invariants

1. Clean fixtures certify; punched holes localize exactly their
   boundary edges; duplicated faces read use-count 3; flipped patches
   read misoriented edges; degenerate faces are named (topo-001).
2. Clean surfaces are PROVEN free; planted piercings read `Crossing`
   with pair localization; exactly coincident patches read `Touching`;
   near-tangent surfaces at 1e-4 separation do NOT false-FAIL
   (topo-002). Historical note: this certificate's first run caught a
   real latent bug in `shapes::icosphere` (off-origin midpoint
   projection) — the zoo's fixtures are honest witnesses.
3. Betti triples read exactly on the fixture zoo: ball (1,0,0), solid
   torus (1,1,0) — the tunnel via Euler duality — hollow ball (1,0,1),
   two balls (2,0,0) (topo-003).
4. Two planted wells stay exactly two persistent features under noise
   (1 essential + the shallow well with its analytic birth), against
   dozens of short noise bars (topo-004).
5. Stability: an ε-perturbation moves every surviving bar's endpoints
   by ≤ ε (the bottleneck stability theorem as a property test)
   (topo-005).
6. Persistence is BITWISE reproducible, and the ~10⁶-voxel scale run
   is ledgered with timings (topo-006).

## Error model

Certificates are total over their inputs; voxelization carries
`Cancelled` through. Conservative flags (`Touching`) are typed and
listed rather than silently merged with strict crossings.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: BTree censuses, sorted sweep orders with index
tie-breaks, smaller-root union-find, value-then-index filtration
order. Identical inputs give identical reports bitwise (topo-006).

## Cancellation behavior

`voxelize` (and therefore `verify_topology`) polls `cx.checkpoint()`
per z-slab. Mesh certificates are single-pass and non-blocking.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`, cases topo-001..topo-006 — JSON-line
verdicts, seeded LCG randomness, the fs-obs scale ledger. Any
reimplementation must pass the suite unchanged.

## No-claim boundaries

- Persistence PAIRING is 0-dimensional; 1/2-dimensional persistence
  pairs (full cubical matrix reduction) and persistence-diagram
  matching penalties for ASCENT are the follow-up ([F/M] scope).
- Sequential reduction only; the chunked-PARALLEL reduction for
  10⁸⁺-voxel topology-optimization fields is routed to the perf lane
  with the deterministic-merge requirement attached.
- `verify_topology` is Estimate-grade at its resolution; interval-
  certified topology (no missed sub-cell features) is the sheaf
  certificates bead's.
- Geometric manifoldness is red-flag level (degeneracies, fold-overs);
  full local-injectivity proofs join the interval machinery.
- Voxel connectivity is the 6/6 pair (solid/complement); alternative
  connectivity conventions (26/6) are not exposed.

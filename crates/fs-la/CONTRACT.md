# CONTRACT: fs-la

> Status: PARTIAL — the GEMM, FACTORIZATION, MIXED-PRECISION,
> EIGENSOLVER, and BATCHED SMALL-DENSE sections below are in force.

## Purpose and layer
Dense linear algebra: GEMM, batched small dense, factorizations, eigensolvers. Layer: L1.

## Public types and semantics
- `gemm::{gemm_f64, gemm_f32, gemm_mixed}` — C = α·A·B + β·C on row-major
  contiguous slices (BLAS-shape signatures). β = 0 OVERWRITES C (NaN and
  garbage in C are ignored — the uninitialized-output convention).
  `gemm_mixed` is f32 STORAGE with f64 ACCUMULATION (exact widening; the
  bandwidth-vs-accuracy mode the plan uses throughout).
- `gemm::{GemmScalar, gemm_scalar_checked, GemmShapeError}` — the fixed-order
  scalar-generic reference seam. `GemmScalar` is owned by fs-la so a dependent
  crate can implement it for its own structured scalar without a reverse
  dependency. `gemm_scalar_checked` traverses each row-major output in fixed
  `i,j,k` order, preflights every checked extent and slice length before
  mutation, and returns `ExtentOverflow` / `LengthMismatch` as typed data.
  `is_exact_zero` covers the complete scalar: zero-primal values with nonzero
  derivative or auxiliary lanes execute normally. Exact-zero α does not read
  A/B; exact-zero β does not read old C. The public bit/policy identity is
  `GEMM_SCALAR_SEMANTICS_VERSION = 1`.
- `gemm_f64_op(..., lda, Trans, ..., ldb, Trans, ..., ldc)` — the live f64
  transposed/strided view entry point. `Trans::{N,T}` and each leading
  dimension describe the stored operand without copying; packing absorbs the
  view mapping, so all four operand orientations are bitwise equal to
  `gemm_f64` on materialized operands and rows of C outside the declared view
  remain untouched (tested).
- f64 path: BLIS-style NC→KC→MC blocking with A/B panel packing and an
  MR×NR register-tiled microkernel (safe Rust, fused mul_add). f32/mixed
  paths share the loop order and KC chunking, unpacked in v1.
- `gemm_f64_parallel_with_pool(..., pool, gate)` is the production
  cancellation-aware MC/NC engine. It retains shared-B NC/KC orchestration and
  dispatches disjoint M bands as `TileKernel` work through the caller-owned,
  reusable `TilePool`; every band receives the pool's real `Cx` (gate, budget,
  stream identity, scoped arena, and mode). It returns `GemmRunReport` with one
  fs-exec `RunReport` per NC/KC panel on a full transactional commit, or
  `GemmRunError` after draining all scoped workers; an error leaves
  caller-visible C bitwise unchanged. `gemm_f64_parallel_with_cancel` is the
  convenience wrapper that constructs an unpinned host pool and preserves the
  same structured cancellation/executor error surface.
  `gemm_f64_parallel_with_pool_budgeted` additionally requires a
  `GemmMemoryEnvelope`. Its checked plan covers transactional C staging, shared
  B packing, the reusable M-band table, fs-la's ordered panel-receipt vector,
  and one exact `ArenaPool::reservation_bytes_for_slice` A-panel reservation
  per active `min(pool.workers(), m_bands)` worker. No-product calls plan only
  C staging. Root capacities are fallibly pre-reserved before dispatch; every
  tile receives a finite cost quota equal to one arena reservation; typed arena
  resource refusal drains siblings and returns `MemoryRefused` rather than a
  panic. A reclaim-poison integrity failure is not memory pressure: it retains
  the fs-alloc receipt inside the structured `GemmRunError::Executor` path.
  `GemmMemoryReport` records the requested plan, conservative logical
  reservation high-water (arena attempts count when entered), and refused
  component bytes. Arithmetic uses checked u128 accounting; unrepresentable
  layouts or totals fail closed. Legacy wrappers explicitly use the unbounded
  envelope while retaining the same finite per-tile arena quota.
  `gemm_tuning_is_effective` is the producer-owned routing query used to
  avoid publishing tune evidence for single-thread, small-M, and no-op
  calls. `gemm_execution_tier`, `GEMM_IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION`, the executing
  `TilePool::placement_identity()`, and `GEMM_BUILD_FINGERPRINT` are tune/replay
  identity material. The execution tier is operation-specific: AVX-512 host
  capability maps to the current AVX2/FMA GEMM capsule only when both AVX2 and
  FMA are available; otherwise the scalar fallback is reported. The build fingerprint
  is BLAKE3 over compiler version plus the watched/resolved compiler and active
  wrapper executable bytes, Cargo profile/codegen inputs, target, explicit Rust
  flags, workspace manifests, and a sorted content snapshot of
  the fs-la/fs-simd/fs-exec/fs-alloc/fs-substrate/fs-blake3/fs-obs Rust source
  closure, the constellation lock, and the actual asupersync, proc-macro, and
  Franken evidence/decision/kernel source closure plus its unconditional
  non-source compiler inputs,
  plus an optional explicit `FRANKENSIM_GEMM_CODEGEN_ID` salt; rows from another
  generated-code identity cannot be adopted. Build systems that inject codegen
  settings or code generators outside that bounded closure must supply the
  salt; a missing required environment, source, or workspace identity input is
  a build error rather than a generic fallback. Repository Git metadata is not
  read or encoded: it is provenance, not a code-generation input. Relevant
  dirty or metadata-free asupersync source is content-addressed directly, so
  the repository-material component is identical in a clone, verified export,
  or RCH materialization with the same named source and lock bytes, without
  pretending that a Git HEAD describes the working tree. Other declared build
  inputs, such as the compiler executable, may still distinguish those builds.
  This does not claim that source bytes correspond to the declared
  constellation pin; constellation cleanliness is a separate admission gate.
  Nor does it claim to hash arbitrary external tools or other path-dependency
  sources outside the named closure.
- Dependency-graph evidence (bead fz2.6, codegen schema v3): source bytes do
  not pin dependency CODEGEN. Receipt v1 accepts exactly one explicit
  production root package plus graph-relevant target and root-feature flags;
  workspace, test/dev/all-target, target-kind, and profile selections fail with
  an explicit no-claim diagnosis. Both `cargo metadata` and `cargo tree` run
  with `--locked` through one resolved Cargo executable. The receipt binds that
  executable's bytes and verbose version identity. Stdout and stderr are drained
  concurrently into finite buffers (32 MiB tree, 8 MiB metadata, 1 MiB stderr),
  and the final shared parser/emitter refuses receipts above 1 MiB before print
  or verification.
- Cargo tree supplies distinct normal/build unit feature sets; every human tree
  row must map unambiguously to its structured Cargo-metadata package/source ID.
  A name/version collision without a unique metadata mapping fails closed.
  External rows retain exact metadata IDs. Every local path package in the
  fs-la closure, plus the selected root, receives a clone-stable
  `path+blake3:<digest>#name@version` identity. The digest covers every regular
  file under that package root (including build scripts and non-Rust inputs),
  except `.git` and Cargo `target` output trees; file count, byte count, and
  digest-manifest size are bounded before vectors are allocated. Contained
  regular-file symlinks bind their normalized target; escapes, directory links,
  sockets, devices, unreadable files, and changing/bound-exceeding trees refuse
  a receipt. Exact repeat unit visits deduplicate, while different host/build
  feature sets remain separate sorted rows.
- `build.rs` and xtask compile the same dependency-free canonical format module.
  The build parser binds BOTH the full receipt and its domain-separated BLAKE3
  digest into `GEMM_BUILD_FINGERPRINT`. The full receipt is written under
  `OUT_DIR` and compiled with `include_str!`; only the fixed class/digest markers
  cross `cargo:rustc-env`, avoiding command/environment transport of the JSON.
- The receipt is explicitly **operator-observed**, not verified correspondence
  to the invoking Cargo process: stable Cargo exposes neither an exact unit
  graph nor the build root/selection to a dependency build script. The API
  exposes `GemmGraphEvidenceClass`, `gemm_graph_evidence()`, the class identity,
  and the optional exact `GEMM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT` + digest so a root can require
  and retain the artifact. `GEMM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT_DOMAIN` is the public hash
  domain consumers must use to rehash those retained bytes.
  `receipt:<digest>` means structurally validated
  operator-observed evidence. `salt:<value>` from `.cargo/config.toml` means an
  explicit **development equivalence class**, never verified graph evidence.
  Neither present fails the build. Durable tune rows cannot cross evidence
  classes because the complete material is fingerprint input. See
  `perf-baselines/README.md` for the supported production workflow.
- `factor::{cholesky, lu, qr, tsqr_r, svd_jacobi}` + `FactorError` —
  dense factorizations. Failure is DATA: `NotSpd{index}` /
  `Singular{index}` typed diagnostics, never panics for data conditions.
  `Cholesky::solve`, `Lu::{solve, solve_transpose, condition_1}` (Hager
  1-norm estimate), `Qr::{apply_q, apply_qt, solve_ls}` are the
  refinement/consumer hooks. LU pivot tie-break: LOWEST index under equal
  magnitude (P2). `tsqr_r` computes the sign-canonicalized (non-negative
  diagonal) R over a binary combine tree whose shape is a pure function
  of (m, row_block, n). `svd_jacobi` is one-sided cyclic Jacobi (thin
  U·Σ·Vᵀ, σ descending, deterministic order and tie-breaks).
- `mixed::{solve_adaptive, ResidualTarget, Ladder, RefineReport}` —
  precision-ladder solves with iterative refinement AS POLICY:
  f32-factor/f64-refine → f64-direct → f64-factor/dd-refine. `backward`
  targets the normwise backward error; `forward` (optional) targets the
  relative forward error — the distinction is load-bearing: any stable
  f64 solve is backward-accurate to ~eps, but beating κ·eps FORWARD
  requires the dd (extended-residual) rung, and that is exactly when it
  engages. Every solve returns a `RefineReport` (rung, steps, achieved,
  escalations, condition estimate, correction-ratio forward estimate,
  full residual trajectory) — a precision decision is EVIDENCE, never a
  silent downgrade. Run-dry is reported honestly (converged = false,
  best-achieved recorded), never panicked.
- `eigen::{jacobi_eigh, lanczos_run/LanczosState,
  lobpcg_run/LobpcgState, EigenPair}` — symmetric eigensolvers.
  `jacobi_eigh`: dense cyclic Jacobi (ascending eigenvalues, orthonormal
  columns, lowest-index tie-break). Lanczos (full reorthogonalization)
  and LOBPCG (X−X_prev conjugate direction, optional preconditioner) are
  MATRIX-FREE (operator = `Fn(&[f64], &mut [f64])` closure — fs-sparse
  SpMV or stencils plug in without format coupling) and RESUMABLE
  (checkpoint = state clone; split runs are BITWISE equal to straight
  runs, tested). Every `EigenPair` carries the TRUE operator residual
  ‖A·v − λ·v‖₂ (recomputed, not the internal estimate). Start vectors
  use fs-math STRICT sin — platform libm here caused a real cross-ISA
  golden-hash divergence, caught by the trj pipeline and fixed; this is
  now a contract rule: NO platform libm in any path that feeds solver
  state.
- `eigen_complex::{eig, det_complex, EigFailure}` — general complex
  nonsymmetric eigenvalues: Givens Hessenberg reduction + explicitly
  shifted QR (Wilkinson shifts with total_cmp tie-breaks, exceptional
  shifts every 12 iterations, standard deflation, closed-form 2×2
  blocks). Canonical (re, im)-sorted output. Convergence exhaustion is
  a typed `EigFailure`, never a wrong answer. Tested: companion roots
  of unity, rotation conjugate pairs, agreement with `jacobi_eigh` on
  embedded symmetric matrices (1e-10), trace/determinant identities
  against an independent Gaussian-elimination `det_complex` oracle,
  Hermitian spectral reality, T6 colleague-matrix roots.
- `rand_nla::{range_finder, rsvd, nystrom_psd, sketch_ls, hutchinson,
  hutch_pp, RangeReport, TraceReport}` — randomized NLA [F].
  REPLAYABILITY BY CONSTRUCTION: all randomness flows from keyed Philox
  streams (stable kernel-id registry in-module), so every "stochastic"
  estimate is a pure function of its seed — bitwise reproducible and
  cross-ISA (fs-rand's distributions are themselves bit-deterministic).
  Results carry evidence (probe counts, posterior error estimates,
  variance estimates — the Evidence<T> integration point). Tested:
  rank-r errors within budgeted tails on fast/slow/gap spectra with
  estimate coverage; RSVD leading singular values to 1e-6; Nyström PSD
  reconstruction to 1e-6; sketch-and-precondition LS matches direct QR
  to 1e-8 with fast CG convergence; Hutch++ MSE decisively below
  Hutchinson at matched probe budgets (measured, not cited). The structured
  BEDROCK replay Casebook additionally records a digest over every returned
  field from `range_finder`, `rsvd`, `hutchinson`, and `hutch_pp` on one
  disclosed positive-definite fixture. It requires exact same-seed replay and
  per-API distinct-seed separation, replay-stable input generation under nine
  logical partition plans, and a disclosed seeded reference corruption that
  turns the suite red.
- `VERSION` for provenance stamping.

- `batched::{BatchMat, BatchVec}` — batches of n dense k×k matrices /
  k-vectors in entry-plane SoA layout (one 128-byte-aligned plane per
  entry across the batch; `fs_soa::FieldBuf` storage, plane stride
  padded to 16 f64). Gather/scatter to row-major AoS; plane accessors
  are the SIMD surface (lanes run across ELEMENTS, never within one
  small matrix).
- `batched::batch_gemm` — per matrix C = α·A·B + β·C (β = 0 overwrites,
  the house convention); α = 0 scales/overwrites C without reading A or B,
  matching the core GEMM contract; size classes {4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48}
  dispatch to monomorphized kernels, other k run the same code
  generically.
- The batched-f64 bit surface is `fs-la:batched-f64-bits=1`; its
  `0x0377_a8c9_5992_aee9` golden is registered in
  `golden-couplings.json` and covers reduction order and batch-membership
  invariance. Alpha-zero no-read behavior is locked by a poisoned-operand
  regression because the frozen nonzero-alpha fixture intentionally does
  not move.
- `batched::{batch_det, batch_inv}` — closed forms for k ≤ 4 (Jacobian
  hot path); exactly-zero determinants flagged `Singular`, batch
  continues (flagged outputs unspecified).
- `batched::{batch_cholesky, batch_solve_lower, batch_solve_upper,
  batch_cholesky_solve}` — non-positive pivots flagged
  `NotSpd { index: diagonal step }` per member with the pivot replaced
  by 1.0 (finite continuation, no NaN storm); flag list authoritative.
- `batched::{batch_lu, BatchLu}` — partial pivoting per matrix
  (strictly-greater comparison = lowest row among maximal |pivot|,
  `factor::lu`'s tie-break); compact LU + per-step permutations +
  `Singular` flags; `BatchLu::solve` applies P, L, U in place.
- `batched::{batch_eigh3_values, batch_eigh}` — symmetric 3×3
  eigenvalues in closed form (deterministic trigonometric method
  through strict kernels, ascending); general small k (the 6×6 path)
  per-matrix through `eigen::jacobi_eigh` (values + orthogonal
  vectors).
- Per-element failures reuse `factor::FactorError` as
  `Vec<(matrix_index, FactorError)>` — empty means every member
  succeeded.

## Invariants
1. Packing is ARITHMETIC-NEUTRAL: the packed/blocked f64 path is bitwise
   identical to a same-order naive loop (tested across a 9-shape sweep
   including k=0, m=1, tails in every dimension, tall-skinny, wide).
2. Row (m) and column (n) tiling are bit-neutral; KC chunking is PART OF
   THE BIT CONTRACT (per-chunk register partials fold into C in chunk
   order — changing KC legitimately changes bits and requires a golden
   bump with justification). Submatrix consistency tested.
3. `gemm_mixed` output is bitwise equal to the f64 computation on
   exactly-widened inputs (tested).
4. Cancellation is transactional: a cancelled parallel GEMM may have
   completed private microtiles, but C remains bitwise unchanged after the
   request is observed and every scoped worker drains. A successful call
   crosses one documented non-cancellable final commit boundary.
5. (A·B)ᵀ = Bᵀ·Aᵀ within 1e-13 relative (order differs; not bitwise). The
   transpose action also satisfies the G0 adjoint identity
   `⟨Av,w⟩ = ⟨v,Aᵀw⟩` to `1e−12·(1+|lhs|+|rhs|)` on the generated small-dense
   battery; both dot products must be finite.
6. Factorization residuals (tested): ‖A−LLᵀ‖/‖A‖ ≤ n·1e-14 on SPD;
   LU solve round-trips at 1e-9 on random; A = QR reconstruction at
   1e-12 with Q orthogonal to 1e-13; TSQR R equals direct QR's
   canonicalized R (1e-10) for ANY tree shape and satisfies the Gram
   identity; SVD reconstructs to 1e-13 with U, V orthogonal to 1e-13
   (Hilbert-8 spectral condition lands in the known ~1.5e10 band).
7. Factorizations are bit-deterministic given the blocking constants
   (fixed loop orders; GEMM's KC contract inherited; TSQR tree fixed).
8. The mixed-precision LADDER DECISION is deterministic: fixed thresholds
   (κ·eps32·16 < 1 admits the f32 rung; κ·eps64·16 < forward-target
   admits working-precision rungs), fixed stall rule (two consecutive
   steps without halving), deterministic condition estimator — same
   input, same ladder, same trajectory bits (tested). f32 singularity
   escalates automatically (tested with an f32-collapsing matrix).
9. dd-refinement demonstrably converges to the exact solution of the
   STORED problem: at κ = 1e10 it beats the direct solve's forward error
   by ≥100× against a past-convergence reference (tested). Note the
   no-claim: it cannot recover accuracy already lost when b was rounded
   to f64 — ground truth is A⁻¹·fl(b), not the user's pre-rounding
   intent.
10. The scalar-generic GEMM validates all A/B/C extents before mutation. Its
    α/β fast paths consult full-scalar structural zero, so derivative-bearing
    zero primals cannot lose sensitivities and β = exact zero overwrites
    poisoned output without observing it.

## Error model
Legacy specialized slice-length/shape mismatches panic with structured
messages (programmer errors). `gemm_scalar_checked` instead returns
`GemmShapeError` and leaves C unchanged after any extent/length refusal. DATA
conditions in factorizations return `FactorError` with the
offending index: non-SPD pivots, exactly-singular columns. LU `growth`
exposes the pivot-growth statistic for ledgering. Pool GEMM returns
`GemmRunError::MemoryRefused` when its checked plan exceeds the caller envelope
or a fallible reservation is declined, retaining drained progress and memory
accounting; `MemoryPlanOverflow` refuses before allocation when the plan cannot
be represented. Reclaimed-chunk poison corruption remains an executor
integrity failure rather than being mislabeled as a memory refusal.
Cancellation and executor failures likewise retain the full
`GemmRunReport`, and caller-visible `C` is unchanged on every error path. The
failure-only reports are boxed so the hot `Result` representation remains
small; successful runs still return their report directly.

## Determinism class
GEMM: bit-deterministic CROSS-ISA by construction (fixed per-element loop
order and fused mul_add; MC/NC work assignment is disjoint and bit-neutral
across thread counts). Evidence: FNV-64 golden hash over a
48×36×300 α-scaled product = `0x1d7a_a3c6_b631_7ef0`, recorded on
aarch64-apple, required to match on x86-64 in the test suite.
Factorizations: same class; golden hash over Cholesky L + LU solve +
TSQR R + SVD σ = `0x181f_8f95_82d6_87ed`, verified identical on both
reference ISAs. Mixed precision: ladder decisions + solutions + reports
hashed over a κ ∈ {1e3, 1e7, 1e11} battery = `0x8e09_2d4a_ff1b_5028`
(bumped once: test fixture hardened from platform `powf` to strict
exp/ln). Eigensolvers: Lanczos + LOBPCG outputs on the 1D Laplacian =
`0x87da_0cb3_2344_b097` (bumped once: start vectors moved from platform
sin to strict sin after an ACTUAL cross-ISA divergence — the golden
discipline catching its first real bug). All verified identical on both
reference ISAs. Batched small-dense: bit-deterministic by CONSTRUCTION
and additionally BATCH-MEMBERSHIP INVARIANT — a matrix factored in a
batch of N is bitwise-equal to the same matrix alone in a batch of 1
(each member's arithmetic is independent, all loops fixed-order
mul_add; tested per op family). Golden hash over GEMM + Cholesky solve
+ LU + det/inv + eigh3 = `0x0377_a8c9_5992_aee9`, verified identical on
both reference ISAs.
Randomized NLA: keyed-Philox replayable (every estimate is a pure
function of its seed); FNV-64 golden over RSVD σ + posterior estimate +
Hutchinson trace = `0xeef1_0550_7daf_c0d5`, verified identical on both
reference ISAs (aarch64-apple M4, x86-64 trj) and in BOTH debug and
release on each (trj:/data/tmp/rn_verify2/run_{release,debug}.log,
2026-07-09). Bumped once with cause: the original fixture
built its spectrum with `f64::powi`, whose rounding is
optimization-level-dependent (1-ulp debug/release divergence from
exponent 4 up), so the sentinel bits depended on build mode
(0x3e92_8bac_8cf9_fd48 debug vs 0xf3dc_b63b_e63f_8ab9 release — the
latter was briefly and incorrectly pinned). The fixture now uses a
fixed-order product chain. Contract rule, sibling of the platform-libm
rule above: NO `f64::powi` with a variable or >3 exponent in any path
that feeds golden bits (tracked workspace-wide in bead
frankensim-powi-build-mode-determinism-4xnt).
The generic GEMM has fixed `i,j,k` traversal and delegates each arithmetic
step to `GemmScalar::mul_add`; its determinism is therefore conditional on the
scalar implementation. The in-tree f64 and fs-ad Dual implementations inherit
the deterministic fused arithmetic contracts above. This statement is a
construction claim, not fresh dual-ISA execution evidence for the new bridge.

## Cancellation behavior
`gemm_f64_parallel_with_pool` implements request → drain → finalize under an
`fs_exec::CancelGate`. It polls while initializing/staging output and
pack storage (every 4096 elements), before each packed A/B micro-panel (at
most MR×KC / NR×KC copies), and before every MR×NR×KC compute tile (at most
8224 fused multiply-adds including alpha/write-back). A request stops
TilePool acquisition; each NC/KC panel uses its deterministic ordinal as the
`run_declared` identity, and that call joins every worker and drops every
tile-scoped arena before returning, which is the drain barrier. All writes
before that barrier target private staging, so cancellation leaves C
unchanged. The current TilePool worker lifetime uses joined
`std::thread::scope`, not yet an asupersync child scope; fs-exec documents that
precise L0 no-claim.
After the final poll, copying the
complete staged result into exclusively borrowed C is the non-cancellable
finalize step; a later request applies to the next operation.

Batched kernels remain bounded synchronous loops; chunking a large batch
to tile quanta (and Cx poll points between chunks) is the fs-exec driver's
job.
`gemm_scalar_checked` is likewise a synchronous, allocation-free reference
loop with no poll points; callers must keep each invocation within their tile
work bound.

## Unsafe boundary
None. `unsafe_code` is denied workspace-wide; any future capsule must be
registered per docs/CONVENTIONS.md and ship a SAFETY.md.

## Feature flags
None. Frontier features use `frontier-*`, moonshots `moonshot-*`, default off.

## Conformance tests
In-crate GEMM suite: bitwise same-order oracle across shape sweep, β/α
edge semantics (β=0 NaN overwrite, α=0, k=0, empty m/n), transpose
identity, submatrix consistency, mixed == widened-f64 bitwise, f32
tolerance battery, determinism + golden hash; G4 deterministic
mid-dispatch cancellation injection proves bounded polling, real TilePool
traversal receipts, worker drain, arena quiescence, and unchanged C; G5 proves
the success path is bitwise the serial contract across 1, 2, host-parallelism,
and advisory-pinned pool configurations.
The shared `fs-casebook` runner records three bounded G0 cases: the retained
`0x1d7a_a3c6_b631_7ef0` GEMM bit golden, exact β=0 overwrite and α=0 poisoned
operand no-read semantics, and deterministic LU tie-breaking plus typed
`Singular { index: 1 }` / `NotSpd { index: 1 }` refusals. Canonical frames bind
bit-semantics versions, generator arithmetic, fixtures, policies, and expected
results. Disclosed seed `0xF51A_0001` corrupts the GEMM golden and must produce
one structured red record plus `assert_green` refusal. This Casebook tranche is
portable G0 evidence; it preserves the larger batteries and makes no new
performance or dual-ISA execution claim. The structured tranche remains
central-package-proof pending.
`fs-ad/tests/la_dual_bridge_casebook.rs` is the cross-crate G0 seam for the
generic reference kernel. It runs a literal `Dual64<2>` 2x2 product inside
fs-la, pins both derivative lanes, compares them bitwise with two `Dual64<1>`
runs and the optimized f64 primal, exercises a nested Dual, and proves
full-scalar zero plus transactional shape-refusal policy. A disclosed
one-bit reference corruption must produce one replay-identical red record and
make the Casebook merge assertion refuse it.
`tests/rand_gemm_replay_casebook.rs` is the cross-crate G5 composition seam
between fs-rand logical streams and fs-la GEMM. It materializes one exact
finite A/B/C fixture from Philox positions keyed by logical matrix identity,
replays those bits under several simulated generation partitions and traversal
orders, and compares the serial kernel bitwise with the actual scoped-thread
GEMM path for `m=257`, `n=7`, `k=9` and worker requests `{1,2,3,5,8}`.
Request `1` is the serial-fallback control; requests `{2,3,5,8}` enter the
current scoped-thread implementation.
Canonical frames bind both crate
versions, the stream and GEMM bit-semantics versions, logical keys, generation
policy, dimensions, alpha/beta, worker schedules, and every input bit. A
disclosed one-bit output-reference corruption must yield one replay-identical
red record and make `assert_green` refuse it. This code-first tranche remains
central-package-proof pending.
`tests/gemm_suite.rs` additionally runs bead 4nh8's 600-case shrink-armed
adjoint-consistency property (seed `0x1A_4A48_0001`) over generated 1×1 through
4×4 dense matrices and vectors. It exercises `gemm_f64` for `Av` and the live
`gemm_f64_op(..., Trans::T, ...)` path for `Aᵀw`; the fixed GEMM golden
`0x1d7a_a3c6_b631_7ef0` and all existing shape pins remain unchanged. This is
a claim about the dense GEMM transpose action, not every operator in fs-la.
`tests/metamorphic.rs` declares the G3 relation
`gemv-vector-scale-equivariance` for `gemm_f64` (seed `0x2ACE_0001`, 384
generated 2×2 matrix/vector/scale cases, `2e-12` absolute-relative component
tolerance). Each generated matrix is a dimensionless linear operator; both
vector components carry one coherent unit, so the positive nonidentity factors
`2^k`, `k in {-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, rescale both input components and
the output together. The exponent remains jointly shrinkable with the operator
input without admitting the identity transform. The fixed shape/oracle/golden
pins and the separate transpose-adjoint property above remain authoritative
and independent.
Batched battery (tests/batched_battery.rs): GEMM vs scalar oracle
across size classes + β-accumulate path; batch-membership bitwise
invariance for Cholesky and pivoted LU; L·Lᵀ reconstruction and solve
for k ∈ {4, 6, 12, 24, 48}; NotSpd/Singular members flagged while 8/9
healthy neighbors stay bit-correct; PA = LU residual + solve; det
closed forms cross-checked against LU diagonal-product-with-parity;
inv·A = I; eigh3 closed form vs per-matrix Jacobi as sorted sets plus
trace identity and eigenvector residuals, degenerate (isotropic and
diagonal) fixtures; 128-byte plane alignment; cross-ISA golden hash.

- Release, macos-aarch64 (Apple M4 Pro, Mac16,11), single thread,
  fs-roofline `MachineAxes::probe()` peak 51.7 GFLOP/s (register-file-
  sized probe): gemm_f64 through the fs-simd NEON 8×4 capsule
  microkernel reaches 43.9–45.1 GFLOP/s at n ∈ {256, 512, 1024}
  square = 85–87% of measured peak — the ≥75% roofline gate PASSES
  (`tests/perf_lane.rs`, best-of-3, 2mnk flop model). n = 128: 38.4
  (0.74 — blocking overheads at small n, reported not gated).
  EXPLORATORY / NON-CITABLE (bead ss0n): this lane normalizes against
  an in-process probe with no historical baseline, sealed
  `ProductionRun`, or ledger Fresh receipt; its rows carry
  `"citable":false` and a pre/post denominator-drift check (>10%
  drift fails the lane). Citable GEMM performance evidence is the
  sealed fs-roofline production family; migrating this lane there is
  tracked follow-up work.
- The capsule (`fs_simd::ops().mk8x4_f64`, NEON `vfmaq_laneq`) is
  BITWISE-identical to the scalar twin per element (same k-ascending
  fused order), so the GEMM golden 0x1d7a_a3c6_b631_7ef0 is
  tier-invariant — verified by the in-crate golden test on both the
  capsule and scalar paths (aarch64 + the twin), and by fs-simd's
  equivalence battery (kc ∈ 0..17 ∪ {256}, special values, nonzero
  starting accumulators).
- The second-ISA (x86-64/AVX) capsule + attainment row are ARMED
  PENDING x86 hardware (fleet ARM-only by census; scalar twin
  dispatches there meanwhile, correct but ungated).

## Perf-lane evidence (bead 9ekv, measured, TARGET NOT MET)
- Batched small-dense (tests/batched_perf_lane.rs, M4 Pro, roofline
  intensity model 24k² B/elem, 2k³ flops/elem, ~50 MB working sets):
  after the 9ekv slice-1 optimizations (m-chunking, fs-simd 4×4-tile
  capsule, power-of-two stride padding, plane-vectorized LU updates —
  all bitwise-neutral, golden 0x0377_a8c9_5992_aee9 unchanged),
  batch_gemm reaches 5.5–15.3 GFLOP/s = 10–29% of each binding roof;
  batch_lu reaches 22–32% of its binding roof. The plan's ≥60% target is
  explicitly compute-peak-relative and is NOT met on this machine: rows report
  both `attainment` (binding roof) and `target_attainment` (compute peak), and
  only the latter decides `target_met`. The asserted lane gate is an
  anti-collapse floor of 0.08 against the binding roof, not the target; an
  environment-invalid row fails the evidence lane rather than yielding a green
  no-claim run. Successor design notes remain in bead 9ekv.

## No-claim boundaries
- The Philox-to-GEMM Casebook proves exact input-generation replay and
  worker-count bit identity only for its disclosed finite fixture in the
  executing build. It is not fresh cross-ISA execution evidence and makes no
  randomness-quality, general-shape, throughput, scheduler-placement, NUMA,
  cancellation, or drain-latency claim. Its finite-f64 mapping from
  `Stream::at` words is test-defined; it does not exercise or claim sequential
  `Stream::next_f64` advancement, checkpoint transport, or distribution
  quality.
- The randomized-NLA replay Casebook is same-build, same-ISA G5 evidence for
  one finite matrix, two seeds, and the named returned fields. It does not
  strengthen the probabilistic error indicators into certified bounds, prove
  approximation accuracy or distribution quality, exercise worker-count or
  cancellation behavior, establish performance, or replace the retained
  cross-ISA golden evidence above. Its seeded red proves that Casebook's merge
  gate rejects one disclosed synthetic RSVD-reference mutation; it is not a
  general production-memory or artifact-corruption detector.
- `gemm_scalar_checked` is a correctness/reference and integration surface,
  not the optimized packed microkernel. It claims no dual SIMD packing,
  roofline attainment, parallel scheduling, cancellation latency, or
  performance parity with `gemm_f64`; arbitrary third-party `GemmScalar`
  implementations retain responsibility for their own arithmetic semantics.
- `FRANKENSIM_DEPGRAPH_RECEIPT` is supplied by the build environment. Strict
  canonical parsing prevents malformed/ambiguous receipt shapes, and
  `--verify` detects later drift under the same declared selection, but neither
  authenticates the operator nor proves that the receipt describes the Cargo
  process compiling fs-la. Receipt-backed publication must retain that exact
  artifact and state this operator-observed boundary. The workspace salt is a
  development equivalence class only; graph correctness and evidence-bearing
  tune publication from salt-class builds are not claimed.
- Path-package hashing covers the complete bounded package-root file tree but
  cannot discover a build script's dynamic reads from environment variables,
  network services, files outside its package root, or previously generated
  Cargo `target` outputs. Such a build must bind those external inputs through
  `FRANKENSIM_GEMM_CODEGEN_ID` (and retain its operator protocol); receipt-only
  equivalence for undisclosed dynamic inputs is not claimed. `.git` metadata and
  build outputs are intentionally non-semantic rather than accidentally hashed.
- Compiler and wrapper executable bytes are watched and content-addressed, but
  a wrapper that changes generated code through mutable configuration outside
  the declared Cargo/Rust environment must set `FRANKENSIM_GEMM_CODEGEN_ID`.
  Tune reuse across an unsalted non-transparent wrapper configuration is not
  claimed.
- `GemmMemoryReport` is deterministic logical reservation accounting, not RSS
  or allocator-overhead measurement. It excludes TilePool slots, deques,
  victim tables, worker stacks, and each `fs_exec::RunReport`'s dynamic
  `cancel_latencies_ns` and `tiles_by_worker` vectors;
  the shared generic executor lease is
  `frankensim-epic-substrate-wf9.16`. Arena high-water counts an allocation
  attempt before calling the allocator so concurrent live reservations cannot
  be underreported; a refused attempt can therefore make the logical peak
  conservatively exceed physically committed bytes.
- Batched small-dense throughput is NOT claimed roofline-competitive
  yet (see 9ekv evidence above): in-kernel AoS repacking or per-matrix
  packed-GEMM routing for large k, the autotuned interleave, and the
  f32/mixed batched variants remain open 9ekv scope.
- Perf scope still open after xdgf slice 1 (recorded successors):
  autotuned MC/NC/microkernel-shape sweep (KC retune = golden bump),
  CCD-aware fs-exec parallel tiling (fz2.2 lane), f32/mixed packed
  paths + capsules, AVX-512 microkernel, nightly perf-regression
  history through fs-roofline::regress.
- Factorization v1 is single-threaded; fs-exec tile-parallel
  panel/update drivers and arena packing are recorded follow-up scope.
  The compact-WY trailing update is applied reflector-sequentially (the
  fused WY GEMM form joins the perf lane).
- `tsqr_r` returns R only; implicit-Q tree factors (for applying Qᵀ in
  parallel TSQR) join the fs-exec driver work.
- `condition_1` is an estimate (typically within a small factor; a lower
  bound in theory) — not a certified bound (fs-ivl owns certified claims).
- Jacobi SVD targets small/medium n (O(n²·m) per sweep); no blocked
  driver yet.
- Batched small-dense makes NO roofline-competitive claim yet. The current
  packed 4×4 f64/f32 capsules are bitwise-equivalent execution paths, but the
  ≥60%-of-compute-peak acceptance, autotuned interleave width, and a
  lane-vectorized pivoted LU remain open. Batched QR/SVD and eigh3 closed-form
  EIGENVECTORS (currently via per-matrix Jacobi) are recorded follow-up scope.
- `batched_f32` (9ekv scope e): `BatchMatF32` + `batch_gemm_f32` (fused
  f32 chain) + `batch_gemm_mixed` (f32 storage, EXACT widen, fused f64
  chain, exactly ONE f32 rounding per output — the intended substrate
  for a future LBM moment path; no production `fs-lbm` consumer yet).
  Bit-deterministic and membership-invariant by the same construction as
  the f64 path; own golden `0x5600_7cfe_6a6d_1f9a` (registered against
  `fs-la:batched-f32-bits=2`; v2 fixes the promised α = 0 no-read path),
  verified identical debug+release on
  aarch64. NO performance claim: v1 is plain plane sweeps (no MBLK
  chunking, no packed tiles, no capsules) — the perf treatment joins the
  9ekv lane; cross-ISA golden row pending the next x86 run.
- `eigen_complex::eig` runs UNBALANCED explicit shifted QR (O(n²) per
  sweep; implicit bulge-chasing and a balancing pass are recorded perf/
  robustness refinements) and returns eigenvalues only (eigenvectors
  via inverse iteration are follow-up). Canonical output ordering is
  roundoff-sensitive for near-tied real parts — consumers comparing
  spectra should match as SETS (the battery does).
- Lanczos v1 uses FULL reorthogonalization (selective ω-recurrence is a
  recorded refinement); LOBPCG has no deflation/soft-locking yet and
  identity preconditioning by default. Eigenvector adjoints are recorded
  follow-up (dλ/dp = vᵀ(∂A/∂p)v composes caller-side with fs-ad).
- Randomized-NLA error estimates are PROBABILISTIC indicators with
  empirically validated coverage, not certified bounds (fs-ivl owns
  certificates); SRTT sketches (via fs-fft), an LSQR driver, and
  e-process stopping integration are recorded follow-up scope.
- `condition_estimate` in `RefineReport` is a Hager-style ESTIMATE (not
  a certified bound); the ladder thresholds are engineering headroom,
  not proofs. Componentwise (per-entry) backward targets, Krylov
  inner/outer precision splits, and ledger event emission are recorded
  follow-up scope (fs-obs schema wiring + consumers do not exist yet).

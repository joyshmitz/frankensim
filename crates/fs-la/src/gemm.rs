//! BLIS-style GEMM (plan §6.1): C = α·A·B + β·C, row-major, with cache
//! blocking and panel packing. v1 is the CORRECTNESS + ARCHITECTURE layer
//! in safe Rust: the register-tiled microkernel accumulates in local
//! arrays with fused `mul_add` (auto-vectorizes respectably); the
//! arch-specific fs-simd capsule microkernels and the autotuned blocking
//! sweep are the recorded perf follow-up (gated on the autotuner bead).
//!
//! DETERMINISM CONTRACT: accumulation order is k-ascending within KC
//! chunks, with per-chunk register partials folded into C in chunk order.
//! Hence KC is PART of the bit contract (changing it legitimately changes
//! bits → golden bump with justification); MC/NC are bit-neutral (pure
//! m/n tiling — the fact the future parallel lane relies on). Everything
//! is fixed-order +/×/mul_add: cross-ISA bit-deterministic by
//! construction, golden-hashed in tests.

# CONTRACT: fs-plan

> Status: ACTIVE (models v1). Owns per-operator cost/error models and the
> Error/Time attribution ledgers. The budget ALLOCATOR that optimizes over
> these models is the gp3.9 bead's; DWR/conformal/MLMC estimator inputs
> arrive with their owning crates.

## Purpose and layer

Plan §11.4 (Bet 12), Decalogue P4: every operator publishes an error model
and a cost model; composition composes the models, so "how accurate is
this number and where did the error come from" — and "where did the
seconds go" — are queries over attribution trees. Layer: L6 (HELM).
Runtime deps: `std`, fs-geom, fs-ledger.

## Public types and semantics

- `CostModel` — log-log power-law fit (`cost ≈ exp(a)·size^b`) with
  EMPIRICAL residual quantiles supplying P10/P50/P90 bands; predictions
  carry observation counts and an extrapolation flag (an estimate is
  itself evidenced). Below `MIN_OBS` it refuses (`CostRefusal`) instead of
  guessing. `observe()` refits online; `calibration()` audits held-out
  band coverage; `median_rel_error()` is the improvement metric.
- `ErrorLedger` — attribution tree over the plan's canonical sources
  (geometry, discretization, algebraic, surrogate, statistical,
  model-form), each entry carrying its `Rigor` class (certified /
  estimated / rate-model). First-order ADDITIVE composition; `total()`
  = Σ contributions + declared residual; `lint()` refuses NaN/negative
  mass (no silent error, ever); `dominant()` names what escalation should
  attack; `explain()` renders the query payload.
- `TimeLedger` — per-stage predicted quantile bands vs measured wall
  seconds, with a band-coverage calibration audit and `explain()`.
- `PlanCostOracle` — implements fs-geom's `CostOracle`, so the Rep Router
  plans with THIS machine's measured history (per-edge models at
  registered reference sizes; recorded actuals feed refits; observed
  error p90 backs `measured_error_abs`).
- `cost_model_from_tune` — rebuilds a kernel's model deterministically
  from fs-ledger `tune` rows (fs-roofline's recorded rates).

- `voi` module (addendum Proposal C, bead knh1.6; [F], behind
  `voi-queries`): the ignorance market, v0 as a RANKED LIST.
  `UncertaintyNode` (interval + nominal), `LiveDecision` (a cached
  surrogate threshold verdict; `flip_probability` sweeps one node's
  interval at grid cost — near-free by construction),
  `Probe`/`ProbeKind` (the priced menu UNIFYING computational and
  physical evidence), `rank_purchases` (MYOPIC one-step VoI:
  flip-probability-per-dollar, deterministic tie-breaks),
  `hint_for_query` (the Proposal-8 anytime hint, now decision-priced),
  `schedule_probes` (greedy affordable top-k — the discrepancy-probe
  scheduler), `audit_verdict` (the kill criterion as code: VoI keeps
  scheduling authority only while recommended purchases measurably
  outperform agent-chosen alternatives; no evidence → no authority).

## Invariants

1. Fits are pure functions of the observation multiset — identical ledger
   snapshots give identical models (P2; arrival order is irrelevant).
2. Predictions always carry uncertainty (bands + n + extrapolation flag);
   thin data refuses structurally.
3. `ErrorLedger::total()` bounds the sum of true per-stage errors whenever
   each contribution bounds its stage (additive conservativeness — the
   fixture-pipeline law).
4. Attribution is complete by construction: unattributed mass must be
   declared residual, and the lint refuses invalid mass.

## Error model

`CostRefusal` (insufficient data, bad input) and `LedgerDefect`
(bad contribution/residual) — structured, teaching, never panics across
the boundary. Ledger I/O errors propagate as `fs_ledger::LedgerError`.

## Determinism class

Deterministic: sorted observations, nearest-rank quantiles with
deterministic tie-breaking, BTreeMap iteration. No RNG anywhere.

## Cancellation behavior

All calls are short pure computations or single ledger reads; no long
loops beyond O(n log n) fits. No `Cx` integration needed at this layer.

## Unsafe boundary

None. Safe Rust only.

## Feature flags

None. The [F]-grade allocator/co-optimizer machinery is deliberately NOT
here (gp3.9, flag-gated there per plan §11.4).

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`: fixture-pipeline conservativeness with tightness
tracked (2000 adversarial draws), completeness-lint refusals, held-out
quantile-band calibration (coverage logged), online-update improvement
under cost drift, deterministic rebuild from ledger tune rows, LIVE Rep
Router replanning from fitted models, Time Ledger attribution +
calibration. Unit tests cover refusals, band ordering, extrapolation
flags, and arrival-order determinism.

## No-claim boundaries

- Error contributions are attribution bookkeeping over estimates or
  certificates; RIGOROUS enclosure composition lives in
  fs-evidence/fs-ivl (each entry's `Rigor` says which you have).
- Cost features are single-scalar (size); multi-feature quantile
  regression is future scope.
- `json_f64_field` is a scanner for OUR canonical flat payloads, not a
  JSON parser (fs-ir owns real JSON).
- No DWR / conformal / MLMC estimator inputs yet — they wire in as their
  owning crates land (the enum slots exist).
- The §11.4 self-optimizing allocator (greedy v1, co-optimizing [M] v2)
  is gp3.9's, not provided here.

## No-claim boundaries (voi)

- MYOPIC one-step VoI only — sequential VoI is intractable and
  deliberately not offered (there is no tree API to misuse).
- The flip probability uses the UNIFORM measure over the node's
  interval (v0's declared prior); posterior-weighted sweeps arrive
  with the Proposal-3 inventory integration.
- One-node-at-a-time sweeps ignore uncertainty INTERACTIONS; joint
  flips are underestimated — documented, not hidden.
- Probe `shrink` factors are menu declarations, not measured
  posteriors; the prospective audit is what keeps the menu honest.

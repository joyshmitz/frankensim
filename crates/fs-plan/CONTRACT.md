## Purpose and layer

Plan §11.4 (Bet 12), Decalogue P4: every operator publishes an error model
and a cost model; composition composes the models, so "how accurate is
this number and where did the error come from" — and "where did the
seconds go" — are queries over attribution trees. Layer: L6 (HELM).
Runtime deps: `std`, fs-geom, fs-ledger.

## Public types and semantics

- `CostModel` — log-log power-law fit (`cost ≈ exp(a)·size^b`) with
  EMPIRICAL residual quantiles supplying P10/P50/P90 bands; predictions
  carry observation counts and an extrapolation flag (an estimate is
  itself evidenced). Below `MIN_OBS` it refuses (`CostRefusal`) instead of
  guessing. `observe()` refits online; `calibration()` audits held-out
  band coverage; `median_rel_error()` is the improvement metric.
- `ErrorLedger` — attribution tree over the plan's canonical sources
  (geometry, discretization, algebraic, surrogate, statistical,
  model-form), each entry carrying a non-blank operator identity and its
  `Rigor` class (certified /
  estimated / rate-model). First-order ADDITIVE composition; `total()`
  = Σ contributions + declared residual; `lint()` refuses NaN/negative
  mass and aggregate overflow (no silent error, ever); `dominant()` names
  what escalation should attack; `explain()` renders strict JSON and emits an
  explicit `valid:false` diagnostic instead of non-JSON NaN/Infinity.
- `TimeLedger` — per-stage predicted quantile bands vs measured wall
  seconds, with a band-coverage calibration audit, a lint for finite
  nonnegative ordered quantiles/measured times and aggregate overflow, and a
  strict-JSON `explain()` (`null`, never Rust `Some`/`None` syntax).
- `PlanCostOracle` — implements fs-geom's `CostOracle`, so the Rep Router
  plans with THIS machine's measured history (per-edge models at
  registered reference sizes; recorded actuals feed refits; observed
  error p90 backs `measured_error_abs`).
- `cost_model_from_tune` — rebuilds a kernel's model deterministically
  from fs-ledger `tune` rows (fs-roofline's recorded rates).

- `voi` module (addendum Proposal C, bead knh1.6; [F], behind
  `voi-queries`): the ignorance market, v0 as a RANKED LIST.
  `UncertaintyNode` (interval + nominal), `LiveDecision` (a cached
  surrogate threshold verdict; `flip_probability` sweeps one node's
  interval at grid cost — near-free by construction),
  `Probe`/`ProbeKind` (the priced menu UNIFYING computational and
  physical evidence), `rank_purchases` (MYOPIC one-step VoI:
  flip-probability-per-dollar, deterministic tie-breaks),
  `hint_for_query` (the Proposal-8 anytime hint, now decision-priced),
  `schedule_probes` (greedy affordable top-k — the discrepancy-probe
  scheduler), `audit_verdict` (the kill criterion as code: VoI keeps
  scheduling authority only while recommended purchases measurably
  outperform agent-chosen alternatives; no evidence → no authority).
  Decision, sweep, ranking, and scheduling entry points are fallible:
  arity, nonempty bounded collections/names, unique identities, finite
  ordered intervals, nominal containment, callback margins, target
  resolution, grid and aggregate evaluation work, probe economics,
  ranked values, and budgets are validated before evaluation or spend.
  Duplicate ranked identities refuse rather than buying twice, and a
  positive cost must strictly decrease a finite remaining budget.

- `alloc::{Knob, KnobSetting, AllocProblem, Plan, allocate, Allocator,
  AllocationError, PlanInputError, BudgetInfeasible, oracle_min_error}`
  (bead gp3.9 V1): the
  GREEDY-PLUS-LOOKUP budget allocator — Pareto-ladder upgrades by
  marginal utility Δerror/Δwall under a TROPICAL wall-clock (max over
  parallel tracks of within-track sums, §14.3: slack upgrades are free
  and taken first); online re-planning via `Allocator::observe_error`
  (a-posteriori estimates override model values transactionally and
  re-prune dominance). Constructors, observations, public evaluators,
  and the fixture oracle are fallible. Finite nonnegative scalars,
  Pareto ordering, choice vectors, tracks, knob/setting counts, aggregate
  arithmetic, and oracle Cartesian work are bounded before allocation or
  enumeration. An empty problem is the explicit zero-error/zero-wall
  identity. `allocate` returns only an in-budget plan, otherwise a typed
  malformed-input refusal, `MinimumPlanExceedsBudget`, or a structured
  `BudgetInfeasible` with ranked, VERIFIED relaxations (re-planning at the
  suggested budget succeeds — gated). Measured on the fixture matrix:
  worst greedy/oracle error ratio 1.134 over 60 random problems; the §11.4
  "drag to 2% in 2h" scenario plans to 1.68% at 3600 s with an 8-line
  rationale, deterministically.
- `moonshot::{optimize_exact, waterfill, cma_continuous, RateKnob,
  ScoreRow}` (bead gp3.9 V2, feature `moonshot-planner`, [M], ships
  OFF): the co-optimizer — exact per-track multiple-choice-knapsack DP
  (the tropical budget DECOMPOSES per track; within 2% of the brute
  oracle from bucket rounding only, never loses to V1 — 80 fixtures);
  convex water-filling (KKT bisection) for rate-based models,
  cross-checked by CMA-ES to 1e-16; BIPOP-CMA-ES for non-convex models
  (MEASURED rejection: single-run CMA-ES converges AWAY from
  activation cliffs — surrogate-threshold fixture stuck at spend 0
  with 3.6× the error until BIPOP restarts crossed it). Scoreboard:
  V2 beats-or-ties V1 AND hand allocation on 25/25 fixtures —
  NECESSARY promotion evidence; the flagship-set gate is huq.15's
  Gauntlet call and this feature stays off until it passes.

## Invariants

1. Fits are pure functions of the observation multiset — identical ledger
   snapshots give identical models (P2; arrival order is irrelevant).
2. Predictions always carry uncertainty (bands + n + extrapolation flag);
   thin data refuses structurally.
3. `ErrorLedger::total()` bounds the sum of true per-stage errors whenever
   each contribution bounds its stage (additive conservativeness — the
   fixture-pipeline law).
4. Attribution is complete by construction: unattributed mass must be
   declared residual, and the lint refuses invalid mass.
5. Explanation payloads are valid JSON for valid and invalid internal state.
   Invalid ledgers produce a fail-closed diagnostic object; they never emit
   `NaN`, infinities, or Rust `Debug` option syntax as evidence.

## Error model

`CostRefusal` (insufficient data, bad input), `LedgerDefect` (bad
contribution/residual/aggregate), `TimeLedgerDefect` (bad stage or aggregate),
`PlanInputError`/`AllocationError`, and feature-gated `VoiError` are structured
and teaching; none panic across the boundary. Ledger I/O errors propagate as
`fs_ledger::LedgerError`.

## Determinism class

Deterministic: sorted observations, nearest-rank quantiles with
deterministic tie-breaking, BTreeMap iteration. No RNG anywhere. VoI uses a
fixed sweep and ranking order; its result is deterministic when the supplied
cached surrogate callback is itself deterministic.

## Cancellation behavior

All calls are short pure computations or single ledger reads. VoI sweeps are
bounded by `MAX_VOI_EVALUATIONS`; the fixture oracle has its own Cartesian-work
cap. No `Cx` integration is needed at this layer.

## Unsafe boundary

None. Safe Rust only.

## Feature flags

- `voi-queries` [F] (default OFF) — value-of-information query planning
  (knh1.6, Proposal C); gates the `voi` integration target.
- `moonshot-planner` [M] (default OFF, bead gp3.9) — the co-optimizing
  allocator + fs-dfo dependency; promotion gated on the huq.15 flagship
  Gauntlet (the fixture-matrix scoreboard here is necessary, not
  sufficient).

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`: fixture-pipeline conservativeness with tightness
tracked (2000 adversarial draws), completeness-lint refusals, held-out
quantile-band calibration (coverage logged), online-update improvement
under cost drift, deterministic rebuild from ledger tune rows, LIVE Rep
Router replanning from fitted models, Time Ledger attribution +
calibration. Unit tests cover refusals, band ordering, extrapolation
flags, and arrival-order determinism.

`tests/alloc_battery.rs` covers budget-safe allocation, typed input/work
refusals, online re-planning, oracle bounds, evaluator safety, and tropical
composition. Feature-gated `tests/voi.rs` covers exact boundaries and limit+1,
callback/domain refusals before evaluation, exact target resolution, probe
economics, duplicate scheduling identities, and monotone budget arithmetic.

## No-claim boundaries

- Error contributions are attribution bookkeeping over estimates or
  certificates; RIGOROUS enclosure composition lives in
  fs-evidence/fs-ivl (each entry's `Rigor` says which you have).
- Cost features are single-scalar (size); multi-feature quantile
  regression is future scope.
- `json_f64_field` is a scanner for OUR canonical flat payloads, not a
  JSON parser (fs-ir owns real JSON).
- No DWR / conformal / MLMC estimator inputs yet — they wire in as their
  owning crates land (the enum slots exist).
- Greedy V1 is not an exact optimizer; the fixture oracle is bounded and is
  evidence, not a production planner. Co-optimizing V2 remains `[M]`, default
  OFF, and makes no flagship superiority claim before the huq.15 gate.

## No-claim boundaries (voi)

- MYOPIC one-step VoI only — sequential VoI is intractable and
  deliberately not offered (there is no tree API to misuse).
- The flip probability uses the UNIFORM measure over the node's
  interval (v0's declared prior); posterior-weighted sweeps arrive
  with the Proposal-3 inventory integration.
- One-node-at-a-time sweeps ignore uncertainty INTERACTIONS; joint
  flips are underestimated — documented, not hidden.
- Probe `shrink` factors are menu declarations, not measured
  posteriors; the prospective audit is what keeps the menu honest.
- The library bounds and validates surrogate calls but cannot prove an
  arbitrary callback pure; VoI determinism and replay require the caller to
  supply the declared cached deterministic margin.

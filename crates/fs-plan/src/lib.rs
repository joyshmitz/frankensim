//! fs-plan: per-operator error + cost models and the Error/Time Ledgers
//! (plan §11.4, Bet 12; Decalogue P4). "How accurate is this number and
//! where did the error come from" — and "where did the seconds go" —
//! become QUERIES over attribution trees, not research projects.
//!
//! v1 scope (models; the ALLOCATOR that optimizes over them is gp3.9):
//! - [`cost::CostModel`] — quantile cost predictions (P10/P50/P90) from
//!   observed history via log-log power-law fits with empirical residual
//!   bands; online-updated; refuses instead of guessing on thin data.
//! - [`ledgers::ErrorLedger`] / [`ledgers::TimeLedger`] — attribution
//!   trees with per-source subtotals, dominant-source queries, completeness
//!   lint (no silent error mass), and `explain()` JSON payloads.
//! - [`oracle::PlanCostOracle`] — the Rep Router's `CostOracle` backed by
//!   these models; [`oracle::cost_model_from_tune`] rebuilds models
//!   deterministically from fs-ledger `tune` snapshots.
//!
//! Layer: L6 (HELM). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-geom, fs-ledger.

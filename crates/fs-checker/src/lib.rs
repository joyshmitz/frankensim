//! fs-checker — the standalone evidence-package checker (plan addendum,
//! Proposal 12). Layer: L6.
//!
//! "Don't trust us; here is the checker." A third party — an auditor or a
//! regulator — runs THIS to re-verify a FrankenSim [`EvidencePackage`] without
//! trusting the vendor and, crucially, WITHOUT running any solver. The whole
//! proposition rides the check/produce asymmetry (P6): re-verification is cheap
//! and needs neither the solver stack nor a license.
//!
//! # Hard distribution constraint
//! This crate depends only on `fs-package`; that package's production cone is
//! dependency-free `fs-blake3`, the static `fs-crosswalk` vocabulary, and
//! `fs-evidence` plus its observability utility. There is NO solver, geometry
//! kernel, or license gate anywhere in the cone, so by construction the checker
//! CANNOT run a solve. It carries its own protocol version
//! ([`CHECKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION`]) because it is distributed independently.
//!
//! What it re-verifies: format support + per-claim completeness (delegated to
//! [`EvidencePackage::verify_with`]), the content address (Merkle root,
//! optionally against an expected value — tamper detection), and signature
//! validity when an external capability is supplied. It renders a by-color
//! budget pie only after package verification succeeds. Everything is
//! deterministic for deterministic injected capabilities.

//! Bounded process-stream capture policy (i94v.7.3.3).
//!
//! Process runners own pipes, durable stores, and cancellation tokens. This
//! I/O-free module owns the deterministic admission decision: enqueue,
//! durably spill, explicitly drop, backpressure, or fail proof closure.
//!
//! Proof-critical frames are never converted into lossy gaps. Diagnostic and
//! telemetry frames may be omitted only after a quantified [`ProcessGap`] is
//! retained. A full gap ledger therefore applies backpressure too.

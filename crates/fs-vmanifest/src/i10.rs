//! The I10 constitutive identifiability and optimal coupon design
//! VerificationManifest draft (bead
//! frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.3.3.7.1).
//!
//! The baseline freezes non-confusable law/experiment/nuisance/discrepancy
//! schema identities; adjoint sensitivities published only inside independent
//! outward-rounded finite-difference enclosures; three-valued gauge-witnessed
//! structural identifiability; profile-likelihood/sloppiness practical
//! identifiability with preregistered coverage; conservative three-valued
//! manufacturable coupon/environment/sensor design admission; and blind
//! held-out design gain. Stronger lanes target discrepancy-aware robust
//! design, anytime-valid adaptive law discrimination, a machine-checked
//! identifiable-combination quotient theorem, and certified global design
//! optimality over a frozen finite grammar. A refutation lane attacks false
//! identifiability and design certificates. Preregistration is governance,
//! not proof of a law, parameter, design, theorem, or lab campaign.

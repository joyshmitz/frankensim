//! The RL reality-loop portfolio VerificationManifest draft (bead
//! frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.3.5.1).
//!
//! The first CP/EM/RL/PD portfolio aggregate. RL freezes the SEAMS of the
//! lot-to-experiment-to-deployment loop — the composition of the I05
//! deployment-twin, I06 material-lot, I10 identifiability/coupon-design and
//! I11 campaign/DAQ instance manifests — not their internals: one identity
//! spine across stage boundaries; end-to-end blind-partition custody;
//! exactly-once uncertainty ownership; a frozen calibration/measurement
//! graph; deterministic whole-loop replay; selective reproof after mid-loop
//! change; and weakest-wins deployment gating. Stronger lanes target the
//! anytime-valid adaptive OED loop, target-exact HIL/timing composition, a
//! machine-checked end-to-end composition theorem, and physical-campaign
//! receipt parity. A refutation lane attacks forged cross-stage
//! certificates. Preregistration is governance, not proof of any lot,
//! model, campaign, target, or deployed answer.

IDENTITY=Lot,Specimen,Coupon,Instrument,Calibration,Campaign,Model,Target,Receipt,LoopWorld,Gate and Checker identities have distinct typed domains, canonical preimages, versions and validity; stage boundaries bind exact content addresses; display text, paths and timestamps carry no identity authority; a signature authenticates a receipt, not the loop that produced it\n\
STAGES=the loop graph declares every stage, artifact, receipt and authorized access edge before evidence; stage internals answer to their instance manifests (I05 deployment/timing, I06 material-lot, I10 identifiability/design, I11 campaign/DAQ); the portfolio owns only the seams; no stage skipping or implicit identity bridging\n\
BLINDNESS=partitions frozen at campaign-compile time survive the whole loop; no stage may read another stage's holdout; fabrication metadata, adaptive feedback, diagnostics and failure bundles are leak surfaces in scope; a leak burns the partition permanently\n\
UNCERTAINTY=every component {lot/spatial/aging aleatory,parameter epistemic,measurement,model discrepancy,timing} has exactly one owner at every stage; handoffs neither drop nor double-count; the twin's reported uncertainty decomposes exactly into upstream owned components under outward-rounded interval arithmetic\n\
CALIBRATION=raw DAQ counts reach SI observations only through the frozen versioned calibration/measurement graph; broken,expired,superseded or cyclic edges quarantine exactly their downstream cone; no silent calibration bypass\n\
REPLAY=the whole core loop replays bitwise from its EvidenceRetentionReceipt chain on the same ISA/toolchain fingerprint; inaccessible,redacted or expired inputs constrain replay explicitly and are named in the verdict\n\
REPROOF=a mid-loop change invalidates exactly the declared-graph reachable receipts; unchanged authority is reusable only through authenticated byte-identical lineage; reproof re-enters at the earliest affected stage; a consumed instance-manifest successor version invalidates every receipt bound to the predecessor digest\n\
DEPLOYMENT=the twin serves a QoI only on an all-green,in-domain,unexpired,version-bound support chain; composition is weakest-wins; refusals are typed {StaleEvidence,OutOfDomain,InvalidatedSupport,OwnershipUnknown,Unknown}; no silently degraded answer; no automatic physical actuation\n\
ADAPTIVE=iteration filtration,adaptation policy,stopping rules and gain ledgers freeze before the first adaptive iteration; adaptive designs may consume development data and prior posteriors, never held-out labels; anytime-valid bounds hold under optional stopping\n\
TIMING=HIL/timing/fault receipts are target-exact: exact binary,target,clock/power state and interference assumptions; fingerprint mismatch is OutOfDomain; a measured sample maximum never promotes to a WCET bound anywhere in the chain\n\
THEOREM_AUTHORITY=version 1 prose mints no composition or parity authority; pre-proof successors freeze stage-contract/receipt/chain/property ASTs, semantics, total runtime premises, deterministic AST-to-Lean translation, exact axiom allowlist {propext,Quot.sound,Classical.choice} and transitive closure; sorryAx, custom postulates and native-oracle shortcuts outside the admitted kernel/checker TCB are IntegrityFailed; manual and physical steps are explicit open-world boundaries\n\

HOLDOUT=loop worlds,truth parameters,labels,seeds,checker/policy versions and mutant corpora freeze before access; each Core/Max heldout fixture has one named consumer stage and disjoint range; premature/cross-stage read,label leak,replacement,retry-after-result or post-result tuning is IntegrityFailed\n\
LIFECYCLE=request->drain->finalize; poll at stage,boundary,receipt,iteration,gate and proof/search tile boundaries; checkpoints bind manifest/candidate/evidence cutoff and completed logical ids; resume/fork cannot duplicate stage executions,iterations,wealth or served answers\n\
LOGGING=bounded schema-versioned fs-obs JSONL with stable run/world/stage/case/claim/fixture/leaf/receipt/gate/checker/attempt ids, exact units,seeds,budgets,versions,capabilities and redaction reason; stdout is not evidence\n\
RETENTION=manifest,exact command,code/contract/schema/toolchain/registry hashes,consumed instance-manifest digests,receipt chains,ledgers,graphs,gate decisions,wealth paths,all terminal states,minimized counterexamples and replay-verifier result; promotion/refutation evidence durable; inaccessible/redacted/expired inputs constrain replay and never become silently verified\n\

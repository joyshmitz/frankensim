//! The I04 (conservation-defect microscope) VerificationManifest draft
//! (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.1.3.8.1).
//!
//! Baseline lattice ([S]): local and machine-scale balance attribution,
//! reset/impulse accounting, spatial/temporal/interface defect
//! localization, counterfactual replay with actionable witnesses.
//! Maximal lattice ([F]/[M]): minimal causal explanations across coupled
//! representations, first-divergence guarantees under hybrid topology
//! changes, certified blame stability, and a counterfactual-completeness
//! falsifier lane. A weaker receipt closes its own element and is never
//! relabeled as the stronger theorem.

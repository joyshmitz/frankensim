//! The I15 (executable standards compiler) VerificationManifest draft
//! (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.1.6.8.1).
//!
//! Baseline lattice ([S]): edition-aware clause identity, typed normative
//! rules and human judgments, applicability, obligation execution, scoped
//! conformance receipts with semantic edition diffs. Maximal lattice
//! ([F]/[M]): proof-carrying cross-standard composition,
//! jurisdiction/edition-aware theorem obligations, a transitive-impact
//! completeness falsifier lane, and machine-checkable assurance that
//! structurally cannot erase human authority. A weaker receipt closes its
//! own element and is never relabeled as the stronger theorem.
//!
//! LICENSING BOUNDARY: every fixture in this manifest is a SYNTHETIC
//! standard-shaped pack authored here; no licensed standard text is
//! embedded anywhere. The real editions enter only through the waived
//! external deck slot, pinned later under the fs-vvreg registry
//! discipline.

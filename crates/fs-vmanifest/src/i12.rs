//! The I12 (hybrid mode-automaton compiler) VerificationManifest draft
//! (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.1.5.8.1).
//!
//! Baseline lattice ([S]): typed modes/guards/resets/invariants,
//! per-mode structural consistency, class-qualified complete guard-root
//! accounting on prescribed segments, deterministic superdense-time
//! sequencing, and event-time/generalized derivative protocols. Maximal
//! lattice ([F]/[M]): set-valued simultaneous-order semantics,
//! topology-changing resets, complete bounded-horizon mode coverage
//! with localized Unknown, and certified Zeno/accumulation handling.
//! One preregistered refutation lane hunts the doctrine-D3 Sev-0
//! failure (a fake finite certificate at a grazing tangency). A weaker
//! receipt closes its own element and is never relabeled as the
//! stronger theorem.

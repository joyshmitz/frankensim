//! The I01 (multi-field equation/compiler) VerificationManifest draft
//! (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.1.1.8.1).
//!
//! Baseline lattice ([S]): typed law/port semantics, residual/JVP/VJP
//! actions, block lowering, conservation and exact-sequence obligations,
//! deterministic cancellation-correct replay. Maximal lattice ([F]/[M]):
//! exact-discrete adjoints and DWR, representation-independent coupled
//! action equivalence, generated multiphysics law completeness, and
//! solver-hint optimality under certified budgets. A weaker receipt closes
//! its own element and is never relabeled as the stronger theorem.

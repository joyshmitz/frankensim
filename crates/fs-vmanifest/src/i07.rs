//! The I07 (AP242 semantic manufacturing round trip) VerificationManifest
//! draft (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.2.2.8.1).
//!
//! The baseline lattice ([S]) freezes a bounded ISO 10303-21/AP242 profile,
//! product/configuration/occurrence lineage, representation-qualified geometry,
//! semantic PMI/GD&T, material/process/lot references, harness/EWIS graphs,
//! canonical deterministic export, and an exhaustive semantic-difference
//! receipt. The maximal lattice ([F]/[M]) adds safe opaque-extension capsules,
//! kinematic-pair semantics, partial bidirectional edition migrations,
//! governed real-corpus/standards/interoperability validation with a narrowly
//! scoped external-artifact waiver, proof-carrying semantic equivalence and
//! sheaf/stack descent, plus an independent counterexample lane. A weaker
//! receipt closes only its own lattice element.
//!
//! This is preregistration, not standards, manufacturing, drawing-approval, or
//! regulatory authority. In particular, visual similarity, parser acceptance,
//! and byte-stable output are never substitutes for semantic preservation.

another ordinal, mismatched embedded keys, or an entry absent from the exact registry are \
IntegrityFailed. Ordinals have no profile-authority semantics. --profile <profile-root> means exactly \

runs; no caller-selected favorable member, role, item, stratum, or subset exists. FILE_SCHEMA must \
match the already bound profile; profile/edition inference from FILE_NAME, host filename, vendor, \
FILE_SCHEMA guessing, or entity coincidence is forbidden. REQUEST_SET: the required claim and leaf \
set is frozen before execution; exit 0 means all required authorities passed, never a favorable \

InteroperabilityAxis={NotAssessed,ScopedRequiredMatrixValidated}; \
IndustrialCorpusAxis={NotAssessed,PublicCorpusOnly,GovernedBlindScopedValidation}; \
RegulatoryAxis={NotGranted}. AXIS_AGGREGATION: every non-NotAssessed state carries its exact scope, \
predicate/clause/matrix/corpus, profile assignment, checker, result and adjudication roots. Scoped \
clause conformance requires its clause pack; interoperability requires every preregistered matrix \
cell; only jointly committed untouched-population custody may mint GovernedBlindScopedValidation. \
Public/previously accessed corpora remain PublicCorpusOnly. Missing, inaccessible, failed, stale, or \
selectively omitted components cannot mint a favorable axis. Failed means the runner did not establish its acceptance \
predicate; Refuted requires an independently reproduced in-domain counterexample to the exact \
immutable claim; Unknown means evidence cannot decide; Unsupported is outside admitted \
capability. CROSS_AXIS_VALIDITY: case.finalized forbids ClaimState=Pending. ClaimState=Passed and every \
favorable non-NotAssessed validation axis require ExecutionState=Succeeded, \
EvidenceCompleteness=CompleteEvidence, valid integrity, admitted applicability/support and every \
frozen acceptance predicate Passed. ClaimState=Refuted likewise requires CompleteEvidence plus the \
independently reproduced exact immutable counterexample and ExecutionState=Succeeded. A complete \
supported acceptance failure is ClaimState=Failed; ClaimState=Unsupported requires CompleteEvidence \
of exact non-applicability. PartialEvidence or NoEvidence forces ClaimState=Unknown. \
ExecutionState=Failed, Cancelled, TimedOut, BudgetExhausted, InfrastructureFailed or IntegrityFailed \
cannot carry Passed, Refuted or a favorable validation axis. PartialEvidence and NoEvidence have zero \
promotion authority. INTEGRITY and \
INFRASTRUCTURE never become scientific failure/refutation. EXIT_CODES: \
0=all_requested_claims_passed; 10=failed; 11=refuted; \
12=unknown_or_partial; 13=unsupported; 20=cancelled; 21=timed_out; 22=budget_exhausted; \

LIFECYCLE: request -> admit/refuse -> start -> bounded work -> request_cancel? -> drain -> finalize -> adjudicate -> \
atomic_publish. A successful publication requires one complete atomic AP242/loss-receipt pair; a \
non-success publishes no AP242 artifact and records the explicit absent-artifact disposition in at \
most one atomic terminal/FailureBundle evidence transaction. No path publishes one member of a \
success pair, a partial member, or an unrecorded absence. \
LIFECYCLE_EVENT_CONTRACT: every submitted attempt emits exactly one campaign.requested. A refused \
admission emits no campaign.admitted, case.started or work event and retains one typed refusal/\
finalization receipt. Every admitted attempt emits exactly one campaign.admitted and then exactly one \
case.started before work. Every observer or descendant registration atomically commits its catalog \
membership receipt and acquires its worst-case terminal row-and-encoded-byte reservation before it is \
admitted; a registration with no capacity cannot become live. The first accepted cancellation for one \
open scope/epoch is the primary request: exactly one case.cancel.requested binds request id, scope \
root, request-event identity, primary_request_logical_sequence, supervisor-clock request interval, \
calibration-artifact root and conservative timestamp-uncertainty enclosure, then atomically seals the \
request-time observer-set root/count, descendant-frontier root/count, registration epoch and exact \
terminal reservation. Child admission closes in the same transition: a racing registration either \
commits before the seal and is included with deterministic catalog membership and reservation \
receipts, or is refused and cannot escape either reconciliation. Exact-key byte-identical replay \
returns the primary receipt without another event; a conflicting replay is IntegrityFailed. A later \
distinct request for the sealed, draining or finalized epoch receives deterministic AlreadySealed, \
AlreadyDraining or AlreadyFinalized response bound to the primary event and cannot reopen drain or \
reset latency. On a cancellation path, exactly one case.drain.started follows the primary seal and \
initiates propagation. On a non-cancellation path, exactly one case.drain.started follows the \
earliest applicable work-completion, domain-failure, budget, campaign-timeout or infrastructure \
drain cause without inventing a cancellation seal or observation. \
Every live cancellable logical work unit in the sealed observer set emits exactly one \
case.cancel.observed binding the primary request id/event identity/primary_request_logical_sequence, \
sealed observer root/count, descendant-frontier root/count, registration epoch, admitted unit/tile id, \
deterministic membership proof, optional last-completed boundary, a distinct globally unique \
observation_event_logical_sequence and supervisor-domain calibrated observation interval with an \
outward uncertainty enclosure. Observation forbids every new domain, candidate, protected-access, \
adjudication or publication effect in that unit; only already reserved bounded cleanup, descendant \
join, exit-receipt, drain and finalization work may continue, and none may mint new scientific \
authority. \
On a cancellation path, case.drain.completed carries the sealed roots/counts and a complete \
exit-reconciliation root and may occur only after every sealed unit has observed cancellation and \
every admitted descendant has one matching membership-plus-exit receipt. On a non-cancellation path, \
it instead carries the exact admitted-frontier root/count and complete exit reconciliation and may \
occur only after every admitted descendant exits; it neither requires nor fabricates a cancellation \
observation. A legitimately empty sealed observer set requires a present, \
independently reconciled root with cardinality zero and exactly zero observations; its \
request-to-observation maximum is exactly zero at seal, but descendant drain is separately mandatory. \
DRAIN_TRIGGER: DrainTrigger={CancellationObserved,EmptyObserverSeal,ObservationTimeoutDrain,\
InfrastructureFailure,NonCancellationDrain}. Its calibrated trigger interval is respectively the \
earliest effective on-time observation interval, the primary-seal interval for an independently \
verified empty observer set, the singleton first nanosecond after the missed inclusive observation \
deadline, the independently receipt-verified infrastructure-failure-onset interval, or the explicit \
drain-start interval. Trigger choice orders effective interval lower endpoint first, causal rank \
InfrastructureFailure=0,CancellationObserved=1,EmptyObserverSeal=2,ObservationTimeoutDrain=3,\
NonCancellationDrain=4 \
second, causal logical sequence third and stable identity fourth. The inclusive observation deadline \
is checked_add(request_interval_lower,250000000 ns) for Core or \
checked_add(request_interval_lower,1000000000 ns) for Max, and its timeout onset is \
checked_add(deadline,1 ns); arithmetic overflow is IntegrityFailed. case.drain.completed carries a \
calibrated drained interval in the same supervisor domain, and case.finalized carries its calibrated \
finalized interval. Conservative trigger-to-drained latency is \
checked_sub(drained_interval_upper,trigger_interval_lower); conservative drained-to-finalized latency \
is checked_sub(finalized_interval_upper,drained_interval_lower). Core caps are inclusively 2000000000 \
ns and 2000000000 ns respectively; Max caps are inclusively 8000000000 ns and 8000000000 ns. The \
failure onset for either cap is exactly the first nanosecond outside its inclusive bound. An \
observation whose interval upper equals the inclusive observation deadline, or a drain/finalization \
conservative latency equal to its inclusive cap, is on time. At the derived timeout onset \
checked_add(deadline,1 ns), an observation completion loses to and latches TimedOut; likewise a \
conservative latency of checked_add(cap,1 ns) latches TimedOut. Overall admitted wall-budget expiry is \
TimedOut. \
TERMINAL_ARBITRATION: any malformed canonical prefix, invalid integrity binding or impossible interval \
selects IntegrityFailed regardless of an operational candidate. Otherwise the earliest \
terminal-eligible logical boundary wins; at the same boundary the exact cause order is \
InfrastructureFailed > TimedOut > Failed > Cancelled > BudgetExhausted > Succeeded. A cancellation \
request makes Succeeded and BudgetExhausted ineligible until the request is observed and the sealed \
frontier drains and finalizes. Cancelled is eligible only when every required observation, descendant \
exit, drain and finalization receipt is complete inside every inclusive cap and no higher cause is \
eligible. A domain/acceptance effect whose own durable commit point precedes the primary cancellation \
may supply Failed; no post-cancellation effect may do so. A receipt-verified supervisor, external \
process, sink, authentication, drain-protocol or publication-protocol failure supplies \
InfrastructureFailed. A missed observation, trigger-to-drained, drained-to-finalized or campaign \
deadline supplies TimedOut. An unverifiable failure without the required receipt sets \
ExecutionState=IntegrityFailed and EvidenceCompleteness=NoEvidence rather than a guessed scientific \
result. case.cancelled is the exactly-once \
terminal-selection event when Cancelled wins; case.failed is exactly once for selected Failed, \
TimedOut, BudgetExhausted, InfrastructureFailed or IntegrityFailed and binds that exact disposition. \
Every admitted attempt emits exactly one case.finalized binding final execution/input/integrity/\
domain/support state and immutable evidence payload, then exactly one claim.adjudicated per requested \
claim binds its claim/evidence axes. Successful adjudication requires exactly one \
evidence.atomic_publish_committed followed by exactly one artifact.published. A non-success may \
publish at most one paired atomic terminal/failure evidence transaction with zero promotion \
authority; a partial/unpaired publication is IntegrityFailed. Duplicate, missing, out-of-order or \
inapplicable lifecycle events, or work/cancellation/drain after case.finalized, never promote. \
For each exact sealed observer member i, conservative latency_i is \
checked_sub(observation_interval_upper_i,request_interval_lower) in nanoseconds in one supervisor \
monotonic domain after applying the receipt-bound calibration and outward drift enclosure; the reported \
latency is max_i(latency_i), inclusively capped at 250000000 ns for Core and 1000000000 ns for Max. \
Overflow, an invalid/expired calibration, an inward enclosure, incomparable domains, an observation \
interval wholly before its request interval, or unknown/duplicate/extra/root-, count- or \
epoch-mismatched observations is IntegrityFailed. A missing or late observation crossing its inclusive \
deadline is TimedOut; preflight inability to establish a common clock or bounded observer is an \
Unsupported admission refusal; a receipt-verified observer/supervisor loss is InfrastructureFailed. \
None can succeed, and incomplete persistence separately lowers EvidenceCompleteness. Raw calibrated \
timestamps, uncertainty and watchdog arrival remain telemetry; request \
event identities, logical sequences, unit/boundary ids, sealed root/epoch and selected disposition \
remain canonical. A legitimately empty admitted \
source and target inventory still publishes a present independently reconciled receipt with both \
roots and zero counts; failure or incomplete inventory can never publish a clean empty item set. \
CHECKPOINT: canonical \
version/type/profile/manifest/case/root/checksum envelope; resume and fork are idempotent; a stale \
or corrupt envelope is IntegrityFailed. LOSS_RECEIPT: complete source and target atom roots, exactly \
one DispositionRecord per source atom and exactly one OriginRecord per target atom; each record has a \
typed zero/one/many counterpart set and derivation/refusal rule, and the forward/inverse incidence \
relations must be exact transposes. Split, merge, synthesis and deletion are never forced into false \
one-to-one lineage. Approximation bounds, opaque capsules, warnings/refusals, owners, authority effects, and \
reconciliation counts. OBSERVABILITY: typed canonical fs-obs JSONL is a non-authoritative mirror. \
One event kind is at most 256 UTF-8 bytes; one complete record including envelope and LF is at most \
1048576 bytes; one durable flush is at most 1024 rows and 4194304 bytes; one run/scope is at most \
65536 rows and 67108864 bytes; the governor retains at most 268435456 bytes across concurrent runs. \
Attempt admission uses checked arithmetic to reserve base ordinary and terminal rows plus their \
worst-case encoded bytes including envelope, redaction and framing overhead. Each observer/descendant \
registration then atomically acquires its incremental worst-case cancellation/drain/finalize rows and \
bytes from the same global ledger before catalog admission; the cancellation seal freezes both catalogs \
and the exact non-borrowable reservation. Transition, observation, drain, adjudication, publication and \
                      failure rows are reserved separately. Every reservation follows exactly \
                      Provisional->Released for refused admission, or \
                      Provisional->Reserved->Consumed|Released for admitted capacity: a refused admission releases every \
                      provisional unit atomically; a durable row consumes its exact row/byte unit; finalization emits one \
reservation-settlement root reconciling every unit as consumed or released with a reason; and crash \
recovery replays the durable ledger to the same settlement without double consumption or leak. A unit \
cannot be released before its possible terminal row is durably made unnecessary, borrowed by another \
run, or retained after settlement. Priority evidence uses an independently serviced bounded writer \
and bounded priority-flush segments; ordinary traffic cannot consume that lane. Admission performs a \
checked global earliest-deadline-first demand-bound test: for every priority deadline d, the sum of \
remaining worst-case durable service time of all already admitted and proposed priority segments with \
deadline <=d must not exceed the remaining writer service capacity through d computed from the \
writer's frozen service rate, elapsed service and nonpreemptive blocking bound. Per-run \
segment_count*worst_case_durable_service_time is necessary but never sufficient. The \
writer's frozen nonpreemptive segment maximum also fits the smallest tier request-observation SLO, so \
priority traffic from concurrent runs cannot queue cancellation observations behind ordinary or other \
priority work beyond its admitted deadline. The global reservation ledger refuses per-run, governor, \
byte, row or service-time overcommit before allocation. High-volume progress is \
deterministically aggregated before event creation by frozen logical tile/shard/window with detail \
in content-addressed Merkle artifacts. No created event is silently dropped, overwritten, truncated, \
arrival-time sampled or spilled without bound. Sink refusal sets \
ExecutionState=InfrastructureFailed and EvidenceCompleteness=PartialEvidence when a durable partial \
FailureBundle exists; if no terminal evidence can persist it sets ExecutionState=InfrastructureFailed \
and EvidenceCompleteness=NoEvidence with zero authority. A slow sink consumes the wall budget; \
admission requires a durable-service bound compatible with the exact observation, drain and \
finalization SLOs. Redact licensed/proprietary payload, personal data, secrets, signatures and absolute host \
paths; log stable ids, domains, digests, counts, bounds, decisions and ranked fixes. RETENTION: canonical input/output native/AP242 \
artifacts, manifest/profile/oracle/TCB roots, semantic loss, proof/falsifier/adjudication receipts, \
checkpoints, logs, and FailureBundle are content-addressed; success and all terminal failures retain \
the minimum replay pack. INDEPENDENCE: threat graph declares shared parser, lexer, schema, semantic \
vocabulary, geometry kernel, units, graph algorithms, generator, data, compiler/toolchain, and human \
review; a second function name is not independence. HOLDOUT: public deterministic ranges are stage \
separation/replay only and have no IID/secrecy authority; access before the named consumer begins is \
IntegrityFailed by campaign policy but the manifest itself cannot enforce custody. \
HOLDOUT_REALIZATION: every version-1 HeldOut AuthoredSpec is only a generator/stratum schema. Before \
access, a FrozenManifest::amend successor replaces it with a content-addressed realized artifact root \
and binds generator/toolchain, canonical case count/order, Merkle root, custodian signatures, \
candidate/checker/ProfileRegistryRoot/ProfileAssignmentRoot, scales, tolerances, and decision code; \
until then no holdout capability or promotion authority exists. JOINT_REVEAL: a leaf consuming \
multiple protected strata gets one atomic signed commitment over every realized root plus candidate, \
checker, profile registry/assignment, scales, tolerances, and decision code before any root, byte, \
summary, or derived label is revealed. Sequential reveal, tuning between strata, selective opening, \
or retry is IntegrityFailed and splitting strata never creates another attempt. GOVERNED_EXTERNAL: \
public standard/conformance corpora may support only their exact StandardAxis or PublicCorpusOnly \
scope; industrial blind authority additionally requires untouched-population custody and the same \
joint commitment discipline over candidate, checker, expectations, profiles, corpus roots and decision \
code. The unresolved i07-governed-real-ap242-corpus deck and its Waiver remain \
NoPromotionAuthority until fs-vvreg verifies an I07GovernedCorpusDischargeReceiptV1 precommit \
authorization binding the exact \
waiver subject/predicate, typed artifact kind, license/access/custody, standard and profile identities, \
realized item/corpus/expectation roots, candidate/checker/toolchain/decision roots, review and \
revocation receipts, predecessor manifest digest, successor version and a domain-separated \
transaction-intent digest. One atomic FrozenManifest::amend authority transaction installs at that \
same deck id an I07GovernedCorpusDischargeEnvelopeV1 root containing the realized-root references and \
precommit authorization receipt, removes the Waiver row, verifies the AmendmentRecord and advances \
the authority head before protected access or adjudication. TRANSACTION_INTENT_V1 defines \
TransactionIntentDigest=BLAKE3::derive_key(\
'org.frankensim.i07.governed-transaction-intent.v1',P), where P is the canonical successor intent \
for exactly one fenced authority transaction. It binds the predecessor manifest and governance-stage \
receipt; expected authority-head digest/generation; immutable CandidateFrozen candidate/checker/\
toolchain/decision/ProfileRegistryRoot/ProfileAssignmentRoot commitment; lexically ordered retired \
waiver subjects; role-addressed (slot_id,artifact_role,artifact_schema_digest,protected_root) records; \
role-addressed future envelope slots that bind each output artifact_schema_digest before Pending; \
coupled transaction group; governance stage/scope; idempotency key/attempt/capability epoch; future \
envelope/final-successor/AmendmentRecord slots; an exact receipt-schema set root; and the exact closed \
GovernedOutputSchemaSetRoot. Separately sorted slot-id and root \
lists are forbidden because any role swap must change P. Cross-field validity requires \
initiative_id='I07', schema_identity='i07-governed-transaction-intent-v1', checked \
successor_version=predecessor_version+1, governance_stage=RealizationCommitted, the exact governed \
authority scope, an expected-head compare-and-swap with generation incremented exactly once and an \
idempotency/capability epoch that prevents ABA replay, and equality of tags 0x0012/0x0013 with the \
opened CandidateFrozen profile-root commitment; because ProfileRegistryRoot and \
ProfileAssignmentRoot transitively bind ProfileDefinitionSchemaRoot and \
RequiredAssignmentUniverseRoot, opening either transitive binding to a different root is \
IntegrityFailed. GovernedOutputSchemaSetRoot is frozen by GovernanceCommitted before candidate \
execution, copied byte-identically into CandidateFrozen, and must byte-equal tag 0x0014 in P. The \
retired-waiver list must equal the exact predecessor-minus-successor waiver-set \
difference. Protected bindings, retired subjects and envelope future artifacts form an exact \
role-addressed bijection. Each future output artifact schema is a mandatory content-addressed canonical \
schema whose bytes are available and independently rehashed before realization, and the realized \
envelope must decode under the byte-identical precommitted schema digest; a caller-selected or merely \
nonzero schema digest has no authority. Every envelope-slot id is unique and the envelope-slot-id set, \
final-successor slot id and AmendmentRecord slot id are pairwise disjoint. \

GovernanceCommitted freezes the exact matrix bytes, \
matrix digest, schema bytes, schema digest and set root before candidate execution; CandidateFrozen \
copies the same set root; P binds it at tag 0x0014; and the precommit authorization carries the exact \
membership proof for the sole FutureArtifact. Authorization verifies protocol/stage/scope, the derived \
role, exactly-one cardinality, exact-waiver rule, protected/future bijection, all three root equalities, \
schema availability and independent rehash before granting realization. The realized envelope must \
decode under the exact thirty-four-field schema and every EqIntentTag and EqCandidateFrozenComponent \
constraint, both exact digest constraints, and every authorization binding must byte-equal its already \
committed source. A permissive substitute schema, matrix \
extension, role alias or swap, missing or extra output, cross-protocol, cross-stage or cross-scope \
schema, absent or forged membership proof, GovernanceCommitted/CandidateFrozen/P root mismatch, or \
schema/output mutation is IntegrityFailed. Untrusted matrix bytes are preflight-capped at 4096 before \

at 65536 before its exact literal or schema constraint is checked; \
schema field count is exactly 34 and schema-set count exactly 1. Top-level matrix, schema, set, proof \
and envelope projections have depth 0; each framed child increments depth once, depth 64 is admitted \
and an attempt to enter depth 65 is refused before recursion or allocation. Counts, lengths and \
cumulative sizes use checked arithmetic against remaining input and caps before allocation or hash \
finalization. Before authority use, two independently implemented matrix/schema/set/proof/envelope \
encoders and decoders must match published exact-byte and exact-root KATs and pass schema-byte, \
field-table, matrix-row, role-derivation, membership, permissive-schema, missing/extra-output, \

decoder recomputes both schema digests and the set root from the exact available schema bytes before \

a missing, extra, swapped or mismatched role/schema is IntegrityFailed. \
I07_ENVELOPE_DIGEST_PENDING_V1 and \

cannot alias a digest. P may bind the already-existing predecessor-stage receipt digest but never \
serializes the newly created authorization/commit receipt digest, realized envelope digest, final \
successor digest or realized AmendmentRecord digest. The embedded \
I07GovernedCorpusDischargeReceiptV1 precommit authorization binds the predecessor/stage receipt, \
expected old head, ReceiptSchemaSetRoot, GovernedOutputSchemaSetRoot and P, but never the realized \
envelope, final successor or new head. The envelope \
embeds only that authorization; the successor embeds the envelope digest; the AmendmentRecord binds \
predecessor and final successor. A separate non-embedded \
I07GovernedCorpusDischargeCommitReceiptV1 atomically binds P, authorization, realized envelope, \
predecessor/final successor, verified AmendmentRecord, ReceiptSchemaSetRoot, \
GovernedOutputSchemaSetRoot and observed old/new \
authority heads. NewAuthorityHeadDigest=H('org.frankensim.i07.authority-head.v1',\

NewAuthorityHeadDigest||U64LE(checked_add(old_generation,1)). The fenced transaction succeeds only if \
the current head byte-equals expected_authority_head, and it durably writes exactly the derived new \
head plus the commit receipt in the same atomic commit; CAS failure, generation overflow or a \
different proposed new head performs no waiver retirement, successor publication, capability grant \

waiver removal alone, split successor, post-reveal amendment or structurally frozen successor without \
the verified fs-vvreg transaction grants no discharge or promotion authority. Before discharge, two \

production import/export path performs no network or URI resolution and executes no plugin, macro, \
script, foreign code, or embedded payload; inputs cannot trigger proof execution or unbounded \

color, plots, proprietary UI, and visual inspection are never the sole carrier. \
DETERMINISM_PROJECTION: the bitwise-comparable logical-event/adjudication projection contains only \
logical ids, deterministic sequence keys, roots, states, bounds and decisions. Raw wall/host \
timestamps, scheduler traces, process ids, durations, percentiles and machine telemetry are retained \
under a separate content root and compared only under preregistered bands; their bytes/root never \
participate in G5 equality. PERFORMANCE: p50/\
p95/p99 wall, peak resident bytes, bytes/entities/edges per second, and cancellation latency bind \
exact model/profile/corpus/machine fingerprints; initially Unmeasured and no speed claim. PROMOTION: \
generated no-orphan/waiver/drift lint, independent manifest adjudication, exact terminal states, \

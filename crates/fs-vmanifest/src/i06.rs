//! The I06 material-lot passport and substitution-impact engine
//! VerificationManifest draft (bead
//! frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.3.2.7.1).
//!
//! The baseline freezes non-confusable material/lot/specimen/process and
//! custody identities; method- and condition-qualified property ingestion;
//! hierarchical lot/spatial/aging uncertainty; ContextOfUse-specific
//! substitution decisions; exact dependency invalidation; anytime-valid
//! supplier drift; and replayable decision receipts. Stronger lanes target
//! coupled multi-property posteriors, identifiable causal transport,
//! transitively complete substitution impact, and robustly optimal material
//! replacement. A refutation lane attacks forged provenance and false impact
//! certificates. Preregistration is governance, not proof of a material,
//! supplier, posterior, causal graph, or replacement decision.

//! The I05 HIL/WCET/fixed-point deployment-twin compiler
//! VerificationManifest draft (bead
//! frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.3.1.7.1).
//!
//! The baseline lattice freezes bounded DeploymentTwinIR admission,
//! range- and error-accounted fixed-point synthesis, reproducible safe
//! `no_std` binaries, non-confusable timing-evidence classes, explicit
//! multi-clock HIL semantics, fail-closed fault/safe-state behavior, and
//! bounded target-refinement evidence. The stronger lattice attempts
//! compositional deadline closure, static/measurement reconciliation,
//! machine-checked floating-to-target refinement, and a complete WCET
//! argument for a deliberately finite target model. A separate refutation
//! lane actively hunts false equivalence certificates. None of these
//! preregistrations is itself target, timing, safety, or theorem authority.

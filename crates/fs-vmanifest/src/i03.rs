//! The I03 (electrostatic/electroquasistatic physics) VerificationManifest
//! draft (bead frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.2.1.8.1).
//!
//! Baseline lattice ([S]): exact cochain identities and independently measured
//! FEEC/CutFEM convergence, gauge and floating-conductor discipline,
//! capacitance extraction, locally conservative conduction, class-specific
//! dielectric admission, quantitative EQS routing, descriptor-circuit power,
//! and held-variable force/adjoint closure. Maximal lattice ([F]/[M]): partial
//! discharge and breakdown, space charge and aging, electrostriction, exact
//! variational naturality, certified refinement defects, topology-event jump
//! theorems, and an independent falsifier lane. A weaker receipt closes only
//! its own lattice element and is never relabeled as a stronger theorem.

floating terminals compares C_eff to C_aa-C_af C_ff^{-1} C_fa using an interval-certified \

temperature {253,293,333}K, relative humidity {0.1,0.5,0.9}, and right censoring. \
DEVELOPMENT CLUSTERS: 512 deterministic material-lot-shaped clusters; each consumes exactly eight consecutive case \
indices and evaluates all five fixture families and both endpoints on every repeat. For a \
partition beginning at seed k0, cluster=floor((k-k0)/8) and repeat=(k-k0) mod 8. For \
each family/endpoint cell, the cluster outcome is the worst-covered repeat, so within-lot \
dependence is arbitrary. This public generator validates algorithms and replay but mints no \
IID or confidence authority; maximal promotion uses the separately governed sampled-lot \
receipt. POPULATION RNG: the output-block ordinal reserves its high 16 bits for factor_id \
and low 48 bits for that factor's local block, so rejection in one factor cannot shift any \
other factor. Lot-level factors use case index k0+8*lot and ids {1:gas,2:pressure, \
3:waveform,4:temperature,5:humidity,6:defect-scale,7:material-threshold}; repeat-level \
measurement factors use the actual k and ids {8:calibration-gain,9:apparent-charge-offset, \
10:voltage-noise,11:stress-noise,12:right-censoring}. For ids 1..5 the local draw starts \
at j=0; for family-specific ids 6..7 it is j=family_index; for ids 8..11 it is \
j=2*family_index+endpoint_index; and id 12 owns the pair \
j=2*(2*family_index+endpoint_index)+{0,1}. Gas, pressure, waveform, temperature, and \
humidity use rejection-sampled uniform choices in their own lanes; defect scale and material \
threshold are independent log-affine draws over [0.5,2] times their family nominal values; \
calibration gain is uniform [0.98,1.02], apparent-charge offset is uniform [-0.5,0.5] pC, \
and voltage and stress noise are two independent uniforms on [-0.005,0.005] of their \
separately declared domain spans. The first id-12 draw censors with probability 0.20; when \
censored, its second draw sets the apparatus limit L_c=(0.5+0.5*u)*nominal-family-span \
inside the pinned finite label domain, and only a true label above L_c is emitted as the \
right-censored compatible set [L_c,2*nominal-family-span]. Otherwise the exact synthetic \
label is emitted. Censoring is therefore repeat/family/endpoint owned, never inferred after \
coverage. The exact analytic family law and a separate 256-bit \
interval label evaluator are serialized per case; no learned candidate generates labels. \
EVENTS: partial discharge is apparent charge >=10 pC within the \
100kHz..20MHz band. AC breakdown is a conductive transition sustained for >=5 drive \
periods; pulse breakdown uses >=5 explicitly declared repetition periods; DC breakdown \
requires current density >=1 A/m2 and field collapse >=80% continuously for the pinned \
absolute dwell 10 ms. WIDTHS: for family f and endpoint e, freeze S_fe>0 and label domain \
D_fe=[0,2*S_fe]. Every predicted P_lrfe is a nonempty closed interval in D_fe; the compatible \
observation C_lrfe is {y} for an exact label or [L_c,2*S_fe] for a censored label. Coverage \
is exactly C_lrfe subseteq P_lrfe. Define H_lrfe=conv(P_lrfe union C_lrfe) and \
w_lrfe=length(H_lrfe)/(2*S_fe); empty, reversed, nonfinite, or out-of-domain intervals fail. \
The lot-cluster coverage bit is the conjunction over eight repeats and its width is \
max_r w_lrfe. STATISTICS: ten cells=five families x {PD inception,breakdown}; \
nominal directed coverage 0.90; each cell uses a one-sided exact Clopper-Pearson lower \
bound at alpha=0.001, so Bonferroni gives simultaneous familywise confidence >=99%, \
and every lower bound must be >=0.90. Exact confidence authority is conditional on the \
independently audited IID sampling receipt; deterministic development outputs receive only \
descriptive coverage. Sharpness is explicitly empirical on the \
512-cluster holdout: after sorting normalized cluster widths nondecreasing, the upper \
median w_(257) must be <=0.20 and nearest-rank p90 w_(ceil(0.90*512))=w_(461) <=0.35 \

wrong-link, wrong-actor, or wrong-payload record is decodable. Custodians sign COMMIT/REVEAL; the admission-bound governance \
key signs CANDIDATE_FIXED/COMMIT_SET_FIXED/BEACON/FINAL. Ed25519 uses RFC8032 PureEdDSA \
with SHA-512, empty context, and no prehash, \
canonical point/scalar encodings, S<L, nonidentity A/R, exact prime-subgroup checks [L]A=0 \
and [L]R=0, k=SHA512(R||A||M) mod L, and the uncofactored equation [S]B_base=R+[k]A; \
noncanonical, off-curve, torsion/mixed-order, or equation-failing inputs are IntegrityFailed. \
Public-key digests use BLAKE3 derive-key domain \
org.frankensim.i03.stat-holdout.key.v1 over the exact 32 key bytes. The entropy commitment is BLAKE3 derive-key \
domain org.frankensim.i03.stat-holdout.commit.v1 over canonical length-framed custodian id, \
verification-key digest, exact 32768-byte vector, and exact 32-byte hiding salt, with the \
signed commit/reveal receipts fixing field order and lengths and the reveal opening both vector \
and salt. The transcript is never candidate- \
visible and exact IID authority does not rely on computational hiding because the candidate is \
already fixed. Each commitment \
opens exactly 32768 bytes parsed as 1024 indexed 256-bit blocks: roles LOT and CANDIDATE_SEED \
crossed with lot indices 0..511, with no spare or variable-length entropy. For custodian c, \
r=LOT=0 or CANDIDATE_SEED=1, and l in 0..511, R_c(r,l) is exactly bytes \
[32*(2*l+r),32*(2*l+r+1)); this lot-major layout admits no padding or alternate role-major \
parse. Exact statistical \
authority is conditional on the explicit, independently audited assumption that at least one \
named custodian generated its entire 1024-block vector information-theoretically IID uniform \
and independent of the other custodians, every adversarial mask and commitment, the already- \
fixed candidate, and population construction; no independence from the order-only beacon is \
required. The sealed simultaneous phase makes \
later commitment-byte adaptation an IntegrityFailed transcript. The other committed vectors \
may be adversarial. Population probabilities are \
canonical integers n_i/2^256, n_i>=0 and sum_i n_i=2^256. Atom order is frozen; \
cumulative endpoints are exact unsigned 257-bit integers canonically encoded as 33-byte \
big-endian values: c_0=0, c_(i+1)=c_i+n_i, and c_N=2^256. A draw u in \
{0,...,2^256-1} selects the unique half-open interval [c_i,c_(i+1)); n_i=0 atoms are \
unreachable. Endpoints must be nondecreasing with no overflow, overlap, or gap. A future \
unpredictable exactly 256-bit public beacon B identified by round/source is bound only after \
COMMIT_SET_FIXED. For role r in {LOT=0,CANDIDATE_SEED=1} and lot l, \
U_(r,l)=R_a(r,l) xor R_b(r,l) xor R_c(r,l). Every reveal/U block is exactly 32-byte \
big-endian; roles use the written numeric tags and l is canonical u16 big-endian. This \
coordinate-wise bijection preserves joint uniformity \
supplied by the honest vector. Interpreting U_(LOT,l) as an unsigned big-endian integer and \
selecting the unique frozen cumulative interval records exactly 512 IID material-lot atoms; \
U_(CANDIDATE_SEED,l) is the disjoint IID per-lot candidate seed. No hash, XOF, PRG, rejection \
stream, short mixed seed, or repeated draw may mint lot-level independence; no candidate or \
single evaluator can choose or grind the realized holdout. B is not a sampling input: its low \
9 bits select an exact cyclic shift of lot evaluation order, its next bit selects direction, and \
the remaining bits are retained as an unused challenge nonce; order-invariance is mandatory, \
so no assumption about B's distribution can alter the lot law or exact confidence authority. \
Every committed reveal is mandatory: a missing/late/duplicate reveal, wrong key, beacon \
substitution, abort, retry, or resampling is IntegrityFailed with no replacement holdout. \
within-lot repeats may be arbitrarily dependent. A secret campaign nonce and raw lot bytes \
are commitment-bound and inaccessible to the candidate until one-shot adjudication is final, \
then revealed and retained for deterministic replay. EXECUTION applies one identical measurable \
candidate map in a fresh stateless scope for every lot. Its complete candidate-visible input is \
exactly {features derived from U_(LOT,l), U_(CANDIDATE_SEED,l), frozen campaign constants}; \
lot ordinal, stable case/receipt id, processing order, shard, worker, campaign nonce, beacon, \
other entropy blocks, and logging metadata remain outside the candidate sandbox. No prior \
label, prediction, feature, cache, model update, RNG state, stopping decision, or lot order may \
affect another lot. Candidate randomness is a \
deterministic function only of the disjoint U_(CANDIDATE_SEED,l) block and frozen artifact and \
is included in each lot receipt; any within-lot expansion is merely part of that deterministic \
randomized-algorithm map and mints no additional independent draw. A secret order permutation \
and a fresh random reassignment of all external case/receipt ids must each produce byte-identical \
per-lot predictions before identically distributed outcome-level IID authority exists. \
Philox may expand retained within-lot inputs into repeat-local simulation noise but mints no \
lot-level IID premise. Exact Clopper-Pearson authority is conditional on the IID receipt and \
the at-least-one-honest uniform-source assumption; absent or compromised entropy, precommitment, access \
control, or one-shot discipline is IntegrityFailed and yields at most descriptive empirical \
coverage. The protocol is public and preregistered; only the committed nonce, raw lots, \
features, predictions, and labels are SEALED until sole consumer i03-breakdown-routing \
enters maximal adjudication, and any earlier realization-byte read is IntegrityFailed. \

number-density units, signed per-particle charges q_bulk in C, and integer closed-reaction \
matrix S_bulk satisfying q_bulk^T S_bulk=0 exactly for every dimensionally homogeneous \

sigma_b=n dot (P_minus-P_plus) in C/m2 and \
dot(sigma_b)+n dot (J_b_plus-J_b_minus)=0 in A/m2. Moving interfaces use the pinned \

field-block isomorphism, forms the exact reduced Schur Hessian, and proves it coercive on \
the mechanical constraint tangent. MIXED retains saddle variables and proves the bordered/KKT \
Hessian is an isomorphism with certified inf-sup beta>0 and fixed Morse index; it makes no \
positive-definite full-Hessian claim. The chosen route proves local uniqueness on the \
declared branch and \
implicit-function regularity. A singular-limit corollary requires a uniform lower bound on \
the same reduced-coercivity or mixed inf-sup constant. Every \
internal-state objectivity law, trace, interface normal, and zero/nonzero surface-energy \

RATIONALS: every scalar is unique reduced p/q with \
|p|<=16 and 1<=q<=16; matrices have dimension <=12, <=48 nonzeros, entry magnitude<=16, \
and SPD candidates pass exact principal-minor checks. SCALAR FUNCTION GRAMMAR: each action, \
load, trace, port, constraint, gauge, state, and QoI scalar is a reduced-rational polynomial \
in x and <=12 scalar state coordinates with total degree<=4, <=64 nonzero monomials, and \
coefficients from the bounded rational grammar; vector/tensor objects have dimension<=12 and \
<=128 total nonzero scalar-polynomial components. WEIGHTS/DATA: rational SPD Hodge/material \
matrices and only those finite scalar/vector/tensor objects. MAP FAMILIES: x belongs to the closed interval [-1,1]; entries of \
P_x,Q_x, restriction transformations, configuration map phi_x, and homotopies are \
rational polynomials of degree<=2 with the same coefficient grammar. Exact polynomial \
chain, inverse-homotopy, descent, action-naturality, and derivative identities certify each \
family; possibly rectangular chain/restriction maps use exact rank and required-minor profiles, \
homotopies use their exact typed identities, and only square configuration/chart maps that \
must be locally invertible use interval Jacobian-determinant or singular-value exclusion of \
zero. VARIATIONAL TRANSFER: condensation cases pin rational vertical/horizontal splittings, \
contractible fibers, interval-coercive vertical Hessians, unique stationary lifts, and exact \
reduced-action/Schur identities. Cyclic cases pin bounded-arity (<=3) rational L_infinity/BV \
higher maps on dimensions<=12, with <=128 nonzero bounded-rational tensor coefficients per \

degrees, nilpotence/completion depth, filtration-preserving maps/homotopies, nondegenerate \
cyclic pairings, master-equation identities, and terminating or convergence-certified higher \
series are bounded and checked. A homotopy inverse proves equivalence of the selected derived \
critical groupoids; the finite-polynomial alternative supplies explicit mutually inverse \

this pair is not an ordinary rational coefficient and is exempt only from the written q bounds. \
GAP is the signed parallel-boundary separation epsilon, ROUNDED_NECK uses the exact algebraic \
circle/sphere radius equation sum_i x_i^2=epsilon^2, and CONDUCTIVITY_BRIDGE uses the exact \
C1 cubic smoothstep h(t)=3*t^2-2*t^3 on t in [0,1]. These named primitive constructors and \
their fixed cubic coefficients are exempt only from ordinary polynomial degree/coefficient \
bounds, including M0's; all composed state/action/QoI and test polynomials remain inside their \

shard partition, and a whole-campaign preflight proof covering exhaustive enumeration, formal \

manifest-version-1 authored card freezes the naturality, signed-refinement-defect, and event- \
jump theorem targets and no-claim boundaries but contains no complete machine proposition \
AST, definition closure, runtime-premise schema, or total translator, so it mints no theorem \
promotion authority. Before any proof/candidate bytes exist, a FrozenManifest::amend successor \
must replace it with canonical machine AST bytes for all three targets, every referenced \
definition or content digest, total schemas mapping each formal hypothesis to runtime evidence, \
and the exact version/source digest of a deterministic AST-to-Lean translator; generated and \
elaborated types must structurally round-trip to the corresponding AST. A later admission \
receipt may not choose or weaken a projection for this version. AXIOM POLICY: exact policy \
i03.lean-axioms.v1 permits only {propext,Quot.sound,Classical.choice}; its digest is BLAKE3 \
derive-key domain org.frankensim.i03.lean-axioms.v1 over the lexically sorted sequence of \
u32-little-endian byte length plus exact UTF-8 name. Every receipt binds that digest and the \
complete transitive declaration/environment axiom closure; sorryAx, any custom/theorem- \
equivalent postulate, and unsafe/native-oracle proof authority are IntegrityFailed. BINDING: \
a canonical table maps \
each theorem-authority manifest claim id to one fully qualified Lean declaration, binds the \
schema-v2 manifest canonical claim_digest using the retained claim.v1 component domain and \
covering every identity-bearing ClaimSpec field, \
and separately hashes the explicit theorem projection and elaborated declaration type. The \
checker receipt carries manifest/card/claim digests, \
declaration name, elaborated-type digest, complete import/environment digest, kernel/ \
toolchain digest, proof-term digest, exact axiom-policy digest, and complete transitive axiom \
closure; any mismatch or axiom outside the exact policy is IntegrityFailed, and runtime premise instantiation is a separate \
content-addressed receipt. The numerical refutation claim \
i03-topology-force-counterexample-search instead binds its canonical claim_digest to the \
independent exhaustive-search/minimization oracle and receives no Lean declaration by alias. \
NATURALITY: representations are variational sheaves over \
pinned finite relative-complex covers. A differentiable restriction-compatible chain \
equivalence P_x,Q_x with coherent descent and certified inverse homotopies receives \
variational authority only through either an equivariant stationary condensation with \
unique smooth vertical stationary lift, coercive/invertible vertical Hessian, and exact \
reduced-action/Schur identity, or complete descending filtered pronilpotent cyclic \
L_infinity/BV data with filtration-preserving morphism/homotopy inverse, fixed completion \
and pairing, master equation, terminating or convergence-certified higher series, and a \
proof of equivalence of the explicitly selected Deligne-Getzler or Hinich derived critical \
groupoids. A finite- \
polynomial alternative supplies checked mutually inverse groupoid functors and natural \
equivalences rather than invoking generic quasi-isomorphism invariance. Each route transports the complete gauge- \
reduced ensemble action including every shape derivative. The declaration derives an \
equivalence of stationary solution groupoids and f_A=phi^*f_B for the \
generalized-force one-form; neither solution nor force/QoI equality is a premise, and \
vector covariance additionally requires a natural metric/Riesz map. REFINEMENT: the \
declaration defines the pinned configuration transfer T_x and gives a signed averaged- \
adjoint identity T_x^*f_h'-f_h=D_primal+D_dual+D_ensemble+D_QoI_transfer+ \
D_homotopy_descent+D_Hodge+D_material+D_geom+D_load+D_trace+D_port+ \
D_gauge+D_constraint+D_quad+D_solver+D_state+D_perturbation+D_endpoint+D_nonlinear. \
Its joint enclosure preserves dependency and cancellation. Componentwise zero is \
sufficient, not necessary; exact covariance requires a proof that the total signed sum is \
zero. EVENT: a pinned regularized stratified cobordism passes exact finite-epsilon charge \
and energy-work ledgers to a declared distribution/Radon-measure limit with disjoint \
ownership and pairwise cancellation of internal transfers. Finite jump, work atom, or \
time-parameterized mechanical impulse requires separate tightness, integrability, and \
renormalization premises; divergence remains explicit. EXPORTS: \
proofs/i03/TopologyForce.lean::representationNaturalityForcePullback, \
proofs/i03/TopologyForce.lean::refinementForceDefectIdentity, and \
proofs/i03/TopologyEventJump.lean::distributionalEventBalance. NUMERICAL ACCEPTANCE: for \
pulled force-covector discrepancy delta_f and certified joint enclosure E, take the \
supremum over the frozen unit-normalized admissible variation set of the distance between \
dual-work pairings divided by 1e-15 J+1e-7 A_dualwork. SCALE_BINDING fixes \
A_dualwork=max(1e-15 J,sup_{v in Vunit}|f_h,oracle[v]|, \
sup_{v in Vunit}|T_x^*f_h',oracle[v]|) from fixture-only independent reference actions, \
with exact norm/pairing, positive floor, formula id, unit id, IEEE bits, and source digest \
before any candidate result. It \
exists for scalar-coenergy and complete constrained-action routes alike; score<=1, every nonvacuity floor holds, \
and verified in-domain counterexample count equals zero. Missing premises yield Unknown; \
binding, ownership, or integrity defects yield IntegrityFailed.",

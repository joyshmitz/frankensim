//! fs-vmanifest — the typed VerificationManifest schema for leapfrog G1
//! claim/evidence freezes (first instance: bead
//! frankensim-leapfrog-2026-program-i94v.1.1.8.1, initiative I01). Layer:
//! UTIL.
//!
//! A G1 freeze preregisters a campaign's claims, fixtures, obligations,
//! and waivers BEFORE any implementation result is inspected, so
//! tolerances, claim wording, capability scope, and failure policy cannot
//! drift toward favorable outcomes. The schema enforces that discipline
//! structurally:
//!
//! - Freezing is fail-closed: [`ManifestDraft::freeze`] refuses blank
//!   fields, over-cap collections (checked BEFORE any deep scan),
//!   duplicate ids, non-independent oracles, orphan deck references,
//!   uncovered claims, invalid tolerances, and malformed digests — each
//!   with a typed [`FreezeRefusal`] naming the gate.
//! - Authority is sealed: [`FrozenManifest`] has no public constructor
//!   and no mutating API; holding one proves the gates ran. Post-freeze
//!   "alteration" is impossible by construction — change happens only
//!   through [`FrozenManifest::amend`], which requires the successor
//!   version and names exactly the invalidated descendants.
//! - Identity is canonical: components sort into one total order with
//!   content tie-breaks, and the manifest digest is a domain-separated,
//!   length-framed BLAKE3 hash, byte-stable across runs on the same ISA.
//!
//! Preregistration is not proof: a frozen manifest asserts nothing about
//! implementation correctness, and no color or promotion authority is
//! minted here.

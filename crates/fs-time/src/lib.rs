//! fs-time — structure-preserving time integration (plan §8.5). Layer:
//! L3 FLUX.
//!
//! Integrators that preserve what the physics preserves: symplectic
//! (Störmer–Verlet, with its discrete-Lagrangian equivalence documented
//! and tested), Lie-group SE(3)/SO(3) via exponential-map updates (no
//! renormalization hacks), generalized-α with CONTROLLABLE dissipation,
//! IMEX and exponential integrators for stiffness, and embedded-pair
//! adaptivity with a PI controller.
//!
//! The two universal obligations (P7 + §8.7): RESUMABLE state machines
//! (checkpoint = clone; split runs bitwise-equal to straight runs) and
//! DISCRETE ADJOINTS of the stepper (Verlet's ships here, checkpointed
//! through fs-ad's revolve; it is the template for the rest).

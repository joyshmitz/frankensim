# fs-recompute — CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

L6 (HELM). Proposal 2's STORE: a content-addressed Merkle DAG whose
nodes record `(op_id, input_hashes, params, code_version_hash,
rng_seed, achieved_error, required_tolerance)`, with the gap
`required_tolerance − achieved_error` as first-class SLACK — the
resource incremental recompute spends. The Error Ledger becomes a
build graph with a soundness certificate for every skip, and
DETERMINISM is promoted from implementation detail to CERTIFIED
CONTRACT (risk R2 owned here).

## Public types and semantics

- `NodeRecord` (the seven-field schema) with `slack()` (negative
  representable — over-budget nodes are first-class and never satisfy
  skips), `content_hash()` (versioned length-prefixed binary canonical
  serialization: params sorted by key, floats by BITS, inputs in order,
  fs-ledger's Blake3-class tree hash), and `to_row()` (valid JSON carrying
  all seven fields + slack, including bit forms, plus exact
  `node_identity` v2 and `artifact_identity` v1 metadata objects). Its public
  input is the raw artifact bytes, from which it derives the typed v1 address;
  callers cannot attach v1 metadata to an arbitrary digest. Caller strings
  cannot inject field delimiters or collide with structured fields.
- `Store::put(record, artifact_bytes)`: content-addressed insert under the
  typed `org.frankensim.fs-recompute.artifact-content.v1` identity. Its
  canonical preimage length-frames that domain, identity version `1`, and the
  exact artifact bytes before BLAKE3 hashing. Identical record + identical
  artifact is a write-time memo hit
  (`Deduped`); identical record + DIFFERENT artifact bytes is
  `StoreError::DeterminismViolation` — the trip-wire that makes the
  determinism contract self-policing. STOP-THE-LINE, not a warning:
  tolerance-level memoization is unsound until the op is fixed.
- `Store::can_skip(record, new_tolerance)`: the skip-soundness oracle.
  Identity for skips excludes the recorded tolerances (a node cached
  under a looser requirement still hits if it ACHIEVED enough);
  `Hit{slack}` is the certificate, `ToleranceTightened{deficit}` names
  the recompute reason, malformed tolerances return `InvalidTolerance`,
  and `Miss` is honest absence.
- `Store::pin(node, PinReason::{EvidencePackage, Contract})`: pinned
  nodes are NEVER evicted; `evict_unpinned(keep)` removes oldest
  unpinned first (deterministic) and cannot touch pins by
  construction.
- `snapshot()`: canonical retained-row v3 text envelope. Its fixed, ordered
  header is exactly `fsrecompute v3`, node identity version/domain, artifact
  identity version/domain, then `--`; rows follow without reinterpretation.
- `Store::admit_snapshot(snapshot)`: validates every v3 header field before
  returning `AdmittedSnapshot::rows()`. It rejects legacy v2, stale/future
  snapshot or identity versions, domain mismatches, malformed headers,
  reordered fields, and noncanonical decimal versions through the structured
  `SnapshotAdmissionError`. Admitted rows are borrowed and opaque.

## Invariants

1. Node hashes are repeat-stable, param-order canonical, and sensitive
   to EVERY one of the seven fields (floats by bits); negative slack
   is first-class; 1000-deep chains are hash-stable; empty/single-node
   stores behave (rcs-001).
2. The determinism trip-wire: the typed artifact-content v1 address changes
   when its domain, version, or artifact bytes change; identical
   (record, artifact) dedupes;
   identical record with different bytes errors with both artifact
   hashes named (rcs-002).
3. Skip decisions carry slack certificates, the exact boundary is a
   zero-slack hit, deficits are named, malformed requested tolerances
   fail closed, and skip identity ignores recorded tolerances (rcs-003).
4. THE CERTIFICATION (G5-at-scale primitive): a fixture study —
   deterministic tile reduction (fs-exec `det_sum` per tile +
   order-fixed `pairwise_fold`) — produces BIT-IDENTICAL artifacts
   across {1,2,4,8} REAL worker threads and adversarial permuted
   completion orders; every re-put is accepted as a dedup by the
   contract (rcs-004).
5. Pins survive eviction; eviction is deterministic oldest-unpinned-
   first; pinning unknown nodes teaches (rcs-005).
6. Ledger rows carry all seven fields + slack and exact node/artifact identity
   metadata; rows and canonical v3 snapshots are bitwise-deterministic across
   builds (rcs-006).
7. Error budgets and slack burns are finite, non-negative magnitudes;
   malformed values refuse without mutation (rcs-007).
8. Snapshot v3 admission is all-or-nothing at the identity envelope: all six
   header lines must be canonical and supported before any opaque row is
   exposed (`snapshot_v3_admission_validates_identity_metadata_before_exposing_rows`).

## Tolerance-aware invalidation (bead lmp4.7, feature-gated)

`invalidate::plan` computes the recompute frontier for a perturbation:
deltas flow `Σ L_e · δ(parent)` through EVERY frontier node (skipped
nodes are STALE by their bound — staleness reaches consumers scaled by
their sensitivities), each node absorbs against its OWN effective
slack, and the recompute set is closed UPWARD along delta-carrying
edges (`PulledByDescendant`: fresh bytes need fresh inputs). Skip
verdicts carry VERIFIED-color interval claims in their rows;
`apply_plan` BURNS absorbed bounds into runtime state (`burned`,
SEPARATE from the immutable record identity — the suite caught an
early design where burning mutated the hashed record and broke
identity), so repeat perturbations see the spent slack. Fail-closed
hardening: exact ties recompute; non-finite sensitivities force
recompute; finite negative sensitivities also force recompute because
they are not magnitude bounds; duplicate perturbations at one source
sum by the triangle inequality; negative slack never skips; δ = 0 is an
empty frontier.
Skip YIELD is the R4 health metric; loose bounds degrade gracefully
to hash-memoization behavior, still correct.

Invariants: flow-through absorption + upward closure (inv-001);
fail-closed zoo (inv-002); the G3 SOUNDNESS battery — over seeded
traces on an executable DAG, EVERY node's final value (cached or
fresh) lies within its tolerance of full-recompute truth, and the
falsifier's forced recomputes agree within their certified bounds;
any violation is Sev-0 (inv-003); graceful degradation with yield
measured (inv-004); verified-color claims + slack burning (inv-005).

`tests/invalidation.rs`, behind `tolerance-invalidation`, emits one canonical
fs-obs `ConformanceCase` aggregate verdict after each completed inv-001..inv-005
case. Each reached verdict is failure-record linted, wire-validated, and printed
before its final assertion. Assertions and expectations that abort earlier
remain Rust test-harness diagnostics rather than claiming aggregate-event
coverage. Inv-003 records its literal LCG input root
`0x1001_2026_0707_0063`; the campaign inputs and conditional falsifier sampling
intentionally continue one coupled stream. Inv-001/002/004/005 are fixed and
use aggregate seed zero. The fixture `NodeRecord::rng_seed` is also zero
throughout but describes manifest records, not hidden test or execution
randomness; this suite has no execution/Cx seed. Inv-004 preserves its
pre-aggregate skip-yield measurement as a linted, wire-validated fs-obs `Custom`
companion under `inv-004/skip-yield`; finite yields remain JSON numbers and
non-finite yields are represented as `null`. Central proof must explicitly
enable `fs-recompute/tolerance-invalidation`; a default-feature pass skips this
test target.

## perturb() API + cache policy (bead lmp4.8, same feature gate)

`api::RecomputeApi` is the operator-facing surface: `perturb(node, δ)`
returns a FIRST-CLASS `PerturbPlan` — the minimal frontier, its
estimated cost from MEASURED per-node costs (Proposal 8's planner
input), the hash-memoization baseline cost, and the verified-color
certificates for everything skipped — pure until `commit` (which burns
slack and updates telemetry). Cache policy: `ensure_capacity` evicts
by COST-WEIGHTED score (recompute-cost × measured hit-probability,
lowest first, deterministic seq tie-break), pins untouchable, and a
pinned population exceeding the capacity is the STRUCTURED
`CacheFullOfPins` refusal — never an OOM. `SkipYield` is the per-op R4
dashboard with worst-first ordering (where bound-tightening effort
goes).

Invariants: diamond plans recompute exactly the un-absorbable
{source, tight} set with certificates for the rest, leaf/root
boundaries behave, plans are pure until commit (api-001); slack is
spendable through the API — repeated absorptions exhaust it (api-002);
cost-weighted eviction preserves hot expensive nodes that insertion-
order LRU would destroy, pins survive, saturation is structured
(api-003); per-op yields separate never-absorbing ops from absorbers,
dashboard live via fs-obs (api-004); the kill-criterion replay
machinery measures certified-vs-memo cost on a 100-variant trace
(fixture-scale; the production decision runs on recorded agent
traces) (api-005). Every plan keeps its verdicts and evidence rows
read-only and captures both the store mutation revision and a deterministic
fingerprint of certificate-relevant state. Committing another plan,
substituting a plan from different state, or otherwise changing the store
makes the plan a structured `StalePlan` refusal, validated before any burn
or telemetry mutation. Duplicate burns are aggregated before the atomic
fit check (api-006).

`tests/api.rs` emits one canonical fs-obs `ConformanceCase` aggregate verdict
after each completed api-001..api-006 case. Assertions and expectations that
abort before that point remain Rust test-harness diagnostics; this suite does
not claim aggregate-event coverage for those early exits. api-005 carries its
actual LCG input seed (`0x1001_2026_0707_0085`); the other five cases are
deterministic and use aggregate seed zero. The fixture `NodeRecord::rng_seed`
is also zero throughout and describes the manifest records, not hidden test
randomness. The api-004 dashboard and api-005 replay measurements use validated
fs-obs `Custom` companion events, keeping runtime measurements out of aggregate
verdict identity.

## Error model

`StoreError::DeterminismViolation` (stop-the-line, with likely-cause
teaching text: unordered reduction, unstable sort, uninitialized
padding), `UnknownNode`, malformed error/burn refusals, and `StalePlan`.
`SnapshotAdmissionError` separately names legacy v2, stale/future versions,
identity-domain mismatches, malformed headers, and noncanonical ordering or
spelling. Nothing panics across the boundary.

## Determinism class

The crate's whole point. Store operations are BTree-ordered and
sequence-numbered; hashing is canonical; the conformance battery
certifies worker-count and completion-order independence of the
fixture study through the store's own trip-wire.

## Cancellation behavior

Store operations are O(log n) point operations (no long loops); the
fixture study's cancellation discipline belongs to fs-exec.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

`tolerance-invalidation` — the lmp4.7 invalidation algorithm AND the
lmp4.8 perturb()/cache-policy API, OFF by default per the Ambition-Tag
gating rule until the Gauntlet tier and kill-metric (≥2× median
wall-clock speedup vs plain memoization on recorded agent traces)
stay green. Adds fs-evidence (the verified-color skip claims).

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`, cases rcs-001..rcs-007 plus the snapshot-v3 admission
matrix — canonical fs-obs `ConformanceCase` aggregate verdicts, seeded LCG
randomness, the fs-obs slack-table event, and fail-closed
legacy/version/domain/canonical-header cases. Each completed rcs-001..rcs-007
case emits one linted, wire-validated aggregate event; assertions and
expectations that abort earlier remain Rust test-harness diagnostics rather
than claiming aggregate-event coverage. rcs-004 carries its fixture-input seed
(`0x1001_2026_0707_0054`) in the aggregate field and records both adversarial
completion-order seeds (`0xA1`, `0xB2`) in its detail; rcs-001..rcs-003 and
rcs-005..rcs-007 are deterministic and use aggregate seed zero. The
`NodeRecord::rng_seed` values exercised throughout, including rcs-004's
`0x54`, are manifest data under test, not test-input randomness. rcs-006
preserves its linted, wire-validated `Custom` slack-table companion. Any
reimplementation must pass the suite unchanged.

## No-claim boundaries

- Cross-ISA certification: rcs-004 certifies across worker counts and
  completion orders on the host; the both-reference-ISA gate rides
  the perf/CI lane's remote runners (the fs-la golden-hash pattern).
- Invalidation traversal (dirty propagation through the DAG) and the
  cache-policy surface are the recompute-invalidate / recompute-api
  beads; this store supplies their pinning hooks.
- The SQLite-backed persistent form (fs-ledger schema v5 tables) is deferred.
  Snapshot v3 is retained-row envelope admission only: `AdmittedSnapshot`
  does not parse row JSON, revalidate row hashes, recover artifact bytes,
  restore pins/sequence/burn/revision state, or construct a `Store`.
- Slack SPENDING policies (which skips to take under a budget) are
  the recompute-api bead's.
- Sensitivity bounds are SUPPLIED (interval-derived by callers);
  adjoint-sharpened bounds (Proposal 1) tighten the loose ones.
- Path-sum accumulation is conservative for shared subpaths (no
  common-subexpression tightening yet).
- Artifact-content v1 intentionally rotates the former raw
  `BLAKE3(artifact_bytes)` address. No legacy artifact-hash migration or
  mixed-version admission is claimed; legacy snapshot v2 is refused rather
  than guessed or upgraded.

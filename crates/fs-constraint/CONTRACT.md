# fs-constraint — CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

L4 (ASCENT). The constraint CALCULUS (plan §9.1, patch Rev F):
constraints with SEMANTICS, not anonymous `g(x) ≤ 0` — a typed kind
taxonomy with per-kind optimizer treatments, evidence-typed
evaluations, and infeasibility DIAGNOSIS (minimal unsat cores, ranked
calibrated repairs) that turns optimizer failures into design
conversations. fs-opt hosts the expression graphs; this crate owns
what the constraints MEAN.

## Public types and semantics

- `ConstraintKind`: `Hard` (never traded → feasibility restoration),
  `Soft(PenaltyLaw::{Quadratic, Hinge})` (→ penalty term), `Chance
  {level, ChanceEstimator::MonteCarlo{samples, delta}}` (→ estimate
  then act on the BOUND), `Robust{half_widths}` and `Certification
  {ProofKind::{Interval, Sos}}` (→ prove or escalate), `Fabrication
  {process}` and `Code{standard}` (→ domain check; semantics named
  for the ledger). `treatment()` is the routing table.
- `evaluate(problem, spec, x, noise) -> ConstraintEvidence`: status
  (`Satisfied`/`Active`/`Violated`/`NeedsProof`/`Proven`/
  `BoundNotCleared`), EXACT violation certificates for algebraic
  graphs, active-set role, penalty per law. Chance kinds compute a
  Hoeffding lower confidence bound and report satisfied ONLY when the
  bound clears the level — `BoundNotCleared` exists precisely for the
  case where the raw empirical rate clears but the bound does not
  (the validity machinery is the feature). Certification kinds refuse
  "satisfied" pointwise REGARDLESS of how good `g(x)` looks.
- `interval_eval` (the in-house prover): rigorous inclusion over
  fs-opt graphs per node; refuses (teaching reasons) on division
  through zero, domain violations, negative powers, PDE/stochastic
  nodes. Before memo allocation it checks the sealed root depth and
  aggregate admission-work receipt against fs-opt's default cap
  schedule, and the walk itself is EXPLICIT-STACK (reachability
  worklist + bottom-up arena-order sweep; bead frankensim-xf8v7), so a
  graph built under looser caps refuses typed and no admitted graph can
  overflow the call stack; the exact max-depth boundary is a G4 fixture.
  `prove_interval` turns a provable domain into a `Proven`
  status + `ProofArtifact::IntervalBound`. Robust kinds are proven
  conservatively over their uncertainty boxes the same way, carrying
  ENCLOSURE certificates.
- `diagnose_infeasibility(problem, specs, domain, cx) -> Diagnosis`:
  elastic-relaxation solve (multi-start projected subgradient descent
  on total hinge violation, deterministic LCG starts) classifies
  feasibility and yields a witness or an unsat core seeded from the
  elastic support and refined by the DELETION FILTER — the core is
  MINIMAL (dropping any member restores feasibility). Repairs
  (relax-bound at graded slacks; drop-soft for soft members) come
  RANKED by Monte-Carlo feasible-volume estimates.
  Domain admission precedes solver allocation and evaluation: exactly
  one `Rn` variable, one range per point coordinate, finite ordered
  endpoints, and a finite span. Equal endpoints are valid fixed
  coordinates.
- `serialize_specs`/`parse_specs`: canonical line form (floats as bit
  patterns), identical round-trips, line-numbered refusals.
- `ConstraintEvidence::to_ledger_row` and `Diagnosis::to_json`: the
  Rev S ledger row and the agent-facing diagnosis payload. All string
  fields receive complete JSON escaping; non-finite public numeric
  fields serialize as `null` rather than malformed JSON numbers. A
  caller-constructed core index missing from the supplied spec table is
  represented by `null`, never an invented constraint name.

## Invariants

1. All seven kinds map to their declared treatments; spec sets
   round-trip identically; ledger rows validate through fs-obs
   (fscon-001).
2. Statuses, roles, exact violation certificates, and both penalty
   laws evaluate as declared (fscon-002).
3. The chance BOUND decides: on an analytic uniform-noise fixture the
   raw rate clearing the level while the Hoeffding bound does not
   yields `BoundNotCleared`, never `Satisfied`; the half-width
   travels as a `StatisticalCertificate` (fscon-003).
4. Certification kinds refuse without artifacts; interval proofs
   succeed exactly on provable domains and refuse honestly otherwise;
   interval containment holds over random nonlinear boxes (G0);
   robust kinds carry enclosures (fscon-004).
5. Unsat cores are MINIMAL against enumeration: the core is jointly
   infeasible, every single deletion restores feasibility, bystanders
   are excluded, feasible systems return witnesses, and elastic
   verdicts match grid enumeration on the seeded fixture family
   (fscon-005).
6. Repairs are ranked by feasibility estimate, soft members offer
   drop actions, and estimates are CALIBRATED against exact
   enumeration (worst gap < 0.05 on the worked mass/strength
   example); the diagnosis payload ships through fs-obs (fscon-006).
7. Malformed elastic domains refuse before allocation/evaluation,
   while fixed axes remain admissible; hostile constraint/repair text
   cannot escape its JSON string and every emitted payload remains
   valid JSON.

## Error model

`ConError` teaching errors: `NotScalar`, `Eval` (fs-opt errors carried
through), `NotProvable{why}` (an honest gap with escalation advice,
not a failure), `BadParam`, `InvalidDomain(DomainError)`,
`Parse{line, what}`. `DomainError` distinguishes host variable count and
manifold, point-dimension representation, range-count mismatch, and an
axis-specific `InvalidRange` reason. The interval engine's
`IvalError` names each refusal reason, including the aggregate cap name,
observed count, and enforced limit.

## Determinism class

Fully deterministic: LCG-seeded multi-starts and Monte-Carlo streams,
canonical constraint ordering, bitwise float serialization. Identical
inputs give identical diagnoses, estimates, and bytes.

The conformance aggregate records distinguish input generation from
execution provenance. Randomized fscon-003, fscon-004, and fscon-005
carry their literal base input seeds `0x1001_2026_0707_0003`,
`0x1001_2026_0707_0004`, and `0x1001_2026_0707_0005`; fscon-003 derives
sample stream `s` as `base ^ s.wrapping_mul(0x9E37_79B9_7F4A_7C15)`.
Fixed-input cases use aggregate seed zero. Scoped-runtime cases
separately use the fixed Cx execution seed `0xC0C0`; that execution
identity is not misreported as randomized input provenance.

## Cancellation behavior

`elastic_solve` (and therefore `diagnose_infeasibility`) polls
`cx.checkpoint()` per restart and returns the carried `Cancelled`
teaching error between solves.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs`, cases fscon-001..fscon-006 — completed aggregate
cases emit `fs_obs::EventKind::ConformanceCase` with Info/Error severity,
failure-record linting, JSONL wire validation, and printing before the
aggregate assertion. Seeded LCG randomness follows the mapping above.
The object-shaped Custom companions for ledger rows and the full
diagnosis payload remain wire-validated and printed, alongside G4
shared-DAG/work and exact/max+1 depth-boundary fixtures for interval
evaluation. Adversarial fixed cases cover malformed domain
bounds/dimensions, fixed axes, hostile JSON text, missing core names,
and non-finite public numeric payloads. Any reimplementation must pass
the suite unchanged.

## No-claim boundaries

- The interval prover rounds to-nearest; outward-rounded arithmetic
  joins with fs-ivl (containment carries an fp-slack caveat until
  then). SOS certificates are REPRESENTED (`ProofKind::Sos`), not
  executable — fs-sos is a later bead.
- The elastic solver is small-fixture machinery (multi-start FD
  subgradient); the production feasibility-restoration solver is a
  later ASCENT bead. Nonconvex fixtures can defeat it — verdicts are
  cross-checked against enumeration only at conformance scale.
- Chance estimation is Monte-Carlo/Hoeffding v1; e-process anytime
  validity and richer estimators join with the UQ beads.
- Fabrication/Code kinds carry semantics to the ledger; process
  models (fs-fab) and code-check rule packs bind in their beads.
- Repair generation covers bound relaxations and soft drops; material
  /topology switches (the patch's richer vocabulary) need fs-xform
  and fs-fab integration.
- Host problems are single-Rn-variable v1; multi-variable and
  manifold-variable domains generalize with the restoration solver.
- Assertions and expectations reached before an aggregate verdict are
  ordinary Rust test diagnostics; an early abort cannot claim that a
  canonical aggregate conformance record was emitted.

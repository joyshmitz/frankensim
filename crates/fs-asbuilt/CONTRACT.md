# CONTRACT: fs-asbuilt

As-built ingestion — reality is just another chart (plan addendum,
Proposal 11): register scan data to the design and emit an honestly colored
as-built candidate.

## Purpose and layer

Layer L2 (representation/geometry). Depends on `fs-evidence` (`Color` and
`ValidityDomain`), `fs-exec` (explicit `Cx`, execution mode, and budgets),
`fs-ivl` (outward-rounded observability enclosures), and the native `fs-blake3`
content-identity primitive. The scientific calculation is deterministic and
uses a closed-form 2-D rigid fit (no SVD).

## Public types and semantics

- `Point2::new(x, y) -> Result<Point2, RegError>` constructs finite points and
  canonicalizes signed zero; coordinates are private and available through
  `x()` / `y()`.
- `Fiducial::new(design, measured)` pairs already-valid typed points; fields
  are private with read-only accessors.
- `register(&[Fiducial], &fs_exec::Cx<'_>) -> Result<Registration, RegError>` —
  the rigid rotation+translation best mapping design → measured (2-D
  Umeyama/Procrustes closed form). Requires `>= MIN_FIDUCIALS` (3)
  non-collinear fiducials and a numerically observable rotation objective;
  retains `residual_rms` as a global fit diagnostic, not registration
  uncertainty. Registration fields
  are private; `Registration::new` is fallible, accessors are read-only, and
  `Registration::apply` refuses non-finite arithmetic overflow.
- `registration_invocation_resources(point_count)` returns the checked typed
  work, poll, cost, evaluation, memory, and retained-output grant for one
  registration. `register_budgeted(fiducials, &mut ChildBudget)` consumes that
  grant from an affine parent-issued child rather than reconstructing an
  allowance from the ambient `Cx`.
- `well_posed(&Registration, certified_deviation) -> bool` — the R8 gate: true
  iff the supplied deviation is finite and positive and the registration
  residual is BELOW the deviation being certified.
- `as_built_diff(&Registration, design, scanned, design_tolerance,
  measurement_noise, calibration_candidate, &fs_exec::Cx<'_>) ->
  Result<AsBuiltDiff, RegError>` — the
  per-point δ after registration; `within_tolerance`, `above_noise_floor`, and
  a `Color::Estimated` whose domain-separated BLAKE3 identity binds every
  scientific function input plus the documented execution subset below.
  `proposed_regime` carries residual/noise/tolerance bounds for later
  authenticated review. The calibration string is a bounded, structurally
  valid candidate identity, never authority. Result fields are private and
  exposed through read-only accessors, so callers cannot forge or mutate an
  authenticated-looking `AsBuiltDiff` value. `max_deviation_index()` retains
  the last input-order index attaining the maximum, including deterministic
  ties, so a composed workflow need not rescan the deviation payload.
- `as_built_diff_invocation_resources(...)` returns the checked typed grant and
  conservative retained-payload shape for one diff.
  `as_built_diff_budgeted(..., &Cx, &mut ChildBudget)` reserves that live-memory
  envelope before allocation, spends through the same affine child, and
  publishes retained output only on success.
- `RegError` covers cancellation with exact phase/progress,
  work-plan overflow, insufficient/collinear/unobservable/interval-unresolved/oversized points, length mismatch,
  empty data, non-finite or negative numeric inputs, malformed calibration
  identity, arithmetic overflow, bounded-allocation failure, and typed
  invocation-budget refusal.

## Invariants

- Registration RECOVERS a ground-truth rigid transform (residual → 0 on clean
  fiducials) and retains the noisy-fit RMS as an advisory diagnostic.
- Well-posedness needs `>= 3` non-collinear fiducials (rank-2 design scatter).
  Centered design and measured coordinates are normalized by their finite
  point-set extents before the relative squared-scatter rank gate and rotation
  objective, so their product expressions do not underflow/overflow merely
  because a representable configuration is uniformly rescaled;
  collinear/too-few is refused. Registration and diff inputs are capped at
  `MAX_AS_BUILT_POINTS`.
- Registration separately requires measured spread and an outward-rounded
  proof that at least one component of the centered cross-covariance vector is
  nonzero. Centroids and both cross sums carry `fs-ivl::Interval` enclosures;
  both enclosures must have finite endpoints. A collapsed measured set returns
  `UnobservableRotation`; if spread exists but both components can contain
  zero, `RotationCertificationUnresolved` reports the distinct numerical
  ambiguity and refuses fail-closed. This rejects collapsed scans and
  reflection/cancellation configurations instead
  of publishing `atan2(0, 0)`'s arbitrary zero-angle convention, without an
  epsilon heuristic.
- Public point, registration, and as-built result fields cannot be forged; all numeric inputs
  are finite, residual/tolerance/noise are non-negative, and unrecoverable
  non-finite arithmetic or a non-finite final result is refused.
- Rotation-plus-translation components preserve the ordinary binary64
  evaluation whenever it is finite and use scaled three-term evaluation when
  a rotation sum overflows before a cancelling finite translation. Recovery is
  fail-closed unless an outward-rounded interval proves the original real
  affine sum remains inside the finite binary64 range. Residual RMS uses scaled
  sum-of-squares accumulation, so a finite RMS is not rejected merely because
  squaring an individual finite distance would overflow.
- R8: `well_posed` requires a finite positive supplied deviation and is false
  when the residual meets or exceeds it (signal below the noise floor).
- The default as-built δ is always `Estimated`. Its bounded identity uses
  length-framed canonical fields followed by a domain-separated native BLAKE3
  digest, preventing delimiter and prefix collisions. Numeric identity fields
  canonicalize `-0.0` to `+0.0`, matching their mathematical equality.
- A well-formed string such as `forged-calibration-claim` cannot promote a
  result: this crate has no validated-promotion API.
- Constant-time preflight declares exactly `6n` point visits for registration
  (extrema/running-mean and anchored-normalized passes for each centroid,
  followed by scatter and residual) and `3n` point visits for a diff
  (deviation, maximum, and identity). Work is checked in `u128` before the
  initial checkpoint. Point scans poll every 256 points, with additional phase
  and final-publication checkpoints; cancellation never publishes a partial
  registration or diff.
- Each typed planner maps logical work to a distinct `WorkUnits` field and an
  equal-valued, representable `CostUnits` field, declares one scientific
  `EvaluationUnits`, and computes its poll and payload byte shapes before a
  child can spend. Registration declares no live-memory payload and only its
  fixed retained result. A diff declares the same conservative byte envelope
  for live memory and retained output. These dimensions are never converted
  into one another by the lower-layer API.
- Budgeted entry points accept only a borrowed, non-cloneable `ChildBudget`.
  Work, cost, evaluation, every poll, memory, and output are charged to that
  child; scientific refusals are latched into the parent receipt. Unused
  capacity returns only when the child is consumed by `finish`, so sibling
  stages cannot mint fresh authority through this crate.
- The `asbuilt-diff-v4` identity binds execution mode, every field of the
  ambient `fs_exec::Budget`, work-plan v2 and exact `3n` shape, poll-policy v2
  and its 256-point/256-byte strides, plus all scientific and provenance inputs.
  `StreamKey` is intentionally not part of this identity. Registration has no
  retained execution identity in this crate.

## Error model

Structured `RegError` values; hostile numeric/identity inputs return errors.
`WorkPlanOverflow` refuses an unrepresentable plan, and `Cancelled` retains the
stable phase plus exact completed/planned point visits.
`InvocationBudget` preserves the underlying typed deadline, cancellation, or
resource refusal from `fs-exec`; a scientific preflight or domain refusal is
also latched fail-closed into that invocation.
Deviation allocation uses `try_reserve_exact`; no public path intentionally
panics.

## Determinism class

The fit, gate, and δ are deterministic functions of their semantic inputs.
G5 tests lock that mode, budget, work-plan, poll-policy version, and stride move
the retained diff identity without changing the numerical result.

## Cancellation behavior

Synchronous and cancellation-aware. Both public long-running entry points take
an explicit `Cx`; preflight precedes the initial poll, long scans poll at the
fixed 256-point stride, and a final checkpoint gates publication. Cancellation
returns `RegError::Cancelled` with exact progress and no partial output.
The budgeted forms poll the child authority, which checks its absolute clock
and originating cancellation gate before spending each poll. Typed output is
not published after a deadline, cancellation, resource, or scientific refusal.

## Conformance tests

`tests/asbuilt.rs`: exact/noisy registration, fiducial well-posedness, R8,
estimated diff semantics, proposed regime, empty/length errors, NaN/infinity/
negative rejection, invalid registration, arithmetic overflow, malformed and
forged calibration identities, delimiter-collision resistance, bounded
identity, signed-zero canonicalization, scale-invariant rank admission, and
deterministic replay; typed resource planning, affine budgeted registration and
diff execution, retained last-maximum index ties, and receipt integrity; G4
pre-cancel, exact stride-boundary, mid-phase, and publication cancellation; and
G5 execution/work/poll identity separation.

## No-claim boundaries

- v1 is 2-D rigid registration (rotation + translation) with KNOWN
  correspondences; 3-D (Kabsch/SVD), scale, and correspondence-free ICP are
  follow-ons.
- Registration is treated as an optimization whose global fit RMS diagnostic
  is propagated into advisory screens and the proposed regime. That residual
  is not transform covariance or a pointwise spatial uncertainty bound.
  Writing it (and the as-built δ) to the design ledger is fs-ledger's
  integration, and the fiducial/datum PRIMITIVES at design time are fs-geom's
  (this crate consumes the correspondences).
- The scan is modeled as sampled points; admitting a full CT voxel grid /
  point cloud as a representation type with restriction maps to interface trace
  spaces extends fs-rep-voxel + fs-geom's chart zoo.
- The δ reuses the deviation metric directly; the full sheaf δ / watertightness
  machinery is the geometry layer's.
- `well_posed`, `within_tolerance`, and `above_noise_floor` are advisory
  residual/dispersion screens, not pointwise uncertainty bounds, statistical
  significance tests, or tolerance certificates.
- Calibration authenticity is an explicit no-claim. A future Validated
  promotion must inject a typed verifier, verify retained calibration artifact
  bytes/content hash under a declared policy, and bind that verification
  receipt. No such API exists in the current crate.
- Point-visit work is a deterministic logical accounting unit, not an
  instruction count or a guarantee about wall-clock latency, memory pressure,
  deadline enforcement, drain behavior, or a 200-microsecond cancellation
  bound. Registration also makes no retained provenance claim about the `Cx`
  under which it ran.
- Typed planner byte counts are conservative semantic payload envelopes, not
  allocator-overhead or process-RSS measurements. `CostUnits` is abstract and
  is not a wall-time, currency, or energy certificate. A planner describes a
  grant but does not itself admit an invocation; the parent `fs-exec` issuer
  owns admission, the absolute deadline, and the terminal receipt.
- The retained diff identity is a replay/integrity binding, not authenticated
  provenance. In addition to `StreamKey`, it excludes arena identity,
  cancel-gate state, scheduler state, and other internal `Cx` state.

//! fs-asbuilt — reality is just another chart (plan addendum, Proposal 11).
//! Layer: L2.
//!
//! A CT scan (or laser point cloud) of the manufactured part is one more
//! REPRESENTATION with its own restriction maps, so "as-built vs as-designed"
//! becomes a δ between two sections — computed by the same watertightness
//! machinery, closing the loop through the physical world. The "validated"
//! color stops being a static stamp and becomes a living, regime-tagged belief.
//!
//! Two facts make this honest:
//! - REGISTRATION (aligning scan to design) is an OPTIMIZATION WITH ERROR.
//!   [`register`] solves the rigid
//!   2-D fit in closed form (no SVD) and is made WELL-POSED by fiducials/datums
//!   specified at design time (≥ 3 non-collinear points) — the
//!   design-for-verification requirement pushed upstream. Its retained RMS is
//!   only a global fit diagnostic, not transform or spatial uncertainty.
//! - The R8 screen is explicit: if that residual exceeds the geometric
//!   deviation under review, the signal is below this advisory noise screen
//!   ([`well_posed`]); no certification claim follows from passing it.
//!
//! The as-built δ ([`as_built_diff`]) is measurement-noise-aware and emits
//! an **estimated candidate** with a proposed regime. A caller-supplied
//! calibration identity is provenance, not authority: this crate exposes no
//! validated-promotion API until an authenticated verifier and retained
//! calibration artifact are available. Both resource-driving entry points
//! require an [`fs_exec::Cx`], poll at fixed point strides, and publish no
//! partial result when cancellation is observed. Deterministic; pure Rust.

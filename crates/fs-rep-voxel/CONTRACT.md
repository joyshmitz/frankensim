# fs-rep-voxel — CONTRACT

Occupancy/multi-material voxel charts, point clouds with normals, and
explicit lattice/strut graphs (plan §7.2) — the discrete-representation
side of MORPH, sharing the sparse VDB substrate with fs-rep-sdf.

Ambition tags: fields/morphology/DT/clouds/lattices [S].

## Purpose and layer

Layer **L2** (MORPH). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-rep-sdf (`VdbGrid`),
fs-geom (`Chart`), fs-exec (`Cx`), fs-evidence, fs-math, and the
constellation's fnx-classes/fnx-runtime (FrankenNetworkx). Consumers:
validity/topology certificates (wqd.23), lattice/infill homogenization
(7tv.14), SIMP consumers.

## Public types and semantics

- `field`: `OccupancyField` (bool active set + immutable validated voxel
  size/origin frame) with fallible active-set booleans
  (union/intersect/subtract) and morphology
  (dilate/erode/open/close, 6-connected — the manufacturing-constraint
  primitives); `MaterialField` (u16 ids, 0 reserved for empty, per-id
  occupancy extraction); `DensityField` (SIMP fractions, out-of-range
  REFUSED not clamped). `OccupancyField::new` rejects non-finite frame
  origins; frame metadata is private and exposed read-only. Boolean
  operations reject frame mismatches before touching the receiver.
  `voxel_of` is fallible: non-finite or out-of-`i32` world coordinates
  never alias a boundary cell through float-cast saturation. Manual
  `Clone` rebuilds through the active set (the substrate carries no
  derives).
- `dt`: `euclidean_dt(field, max_voxels)` — fallible EXACT Euclidean
  distance transform
  (Felzenszwalb–Huttenlocher separable lower envelopes) over the active
  bounding box; squared distances are integer-valued in voxel units and
  conformance checks EQUALITY against the O(n²) reference. Infinite
  (seedless) lines are handled by envelope construction over finite
  parabolas only. Coordinate spans are computed in `i64`, dense volume
  in checked `u128`, and no allocation occurs unless the caller's
  explicit voxel budget admits it. The maximum squared coordinate
  diameter is limited to `< 2^52` voxel units so integer costs and
  envelope decisions remain exact in `f64`. `DistanceField` layout is private and
  read-only so inconsistent dimensions/storage cannot be forged.
- `cloud`: `PointCloud` with grid-hash radius/kNN queries (brute-force
  verified, deterministic tie order), PCA normal estimation (smallest
  covariance eigenvector via cyclic Jacobi), and orientation propagation
  that SURVIVES DISCONNECTED k-NN graphs (scan-line clouds): BFS per
  component with nearest-visited-anchor alignment on restart.
- `lattice`: `LatticeGraph` (nodes with junction blend radii, struts
  with cross-section radii). Coincident nodes, zero-length struts,
  missing indices, and non-positive radii are structured refusals.
  `to_fnx`/`from_fnx` round-trip through FrankenNetworkx with attributes
  preserved exactly. `sdf(p)` realizes the solid as a smooth-min of
  capsule SDFs — a continuous level set, watertight by construction;
  per-strut realization receipts are JSON log lines.
- `chart`: `OccupancyChart::try_new(field, max_voxels)` preflights the
  one-cell complement halo, rejects empty fields and inadmissible dense
  work, then implements fs-geom `Chart`: inside/outside
  from occupancy, distance magnitude from the exact DT on both
  polarities (complement DT inside), an exact active-center scan
  fallback outside the DT box, and an HONEST error certificate — an
  Enclosure of ± half a voxel diagonal, never "exact". An invalid world
  query returns a NaN signed distance with an explicit `NoClaim`
  certificate and no Lipschitz claim.

## Invariants

1. **Morphology matches brute force**; algebra laws hold on fixtures
   (opening ⊆ id removes sub-resolution spurs, closing ⊇ id,
   `(A∪B)\B ⊆ A`, `A∩B ⊆ B`).
2. **The DT is exact within its admitted numeric domain**, not
   approximate: equality with the O(n²) reference on scattered+slab
   fixtures; 1-Lipschitz in the voxel metric. Boxes whose maximum squared
   coordinate diameter is at least `2^52` are structurally refused.
3. **Cloud queries match brute force** (radius and kNN); sphere normals
   are >97% outward-aligned after propagation — including on ring-sampled
   (kNN-disconnected) clouds.
4. **Graph round-trip is lossless**: node positions/radii bitwise, strut
   radii exact, undirected edges deduplicated deterministically.
5. **Realization behaves like a closed solid**: strut midpoints inside,
   far field outside, straight probes cross the boundary an even number
   of times.
6. **Resolution error is declared**: every chart sample carries the
   ±half-diagonal enclosure.
7. **Frames cannot be mixed silently**: occupancy booleans require equal
   voxel size and origin, and any mismatch leaves the receiver unchanged.
8. **Dense work is admitted before execution**: DT and complement boxes
   use checked spans/volumes, respect an explicit maximum voxel count,
   and reject an unrepresentable `i32` halo before iteration or allocation.
9. **World-to-voxel conversion fails closed**: finite admissible values
   retain floor-based cell semantics; NaN, infinity, and out-of-range
   finite values cannot saturate to an apparently valid boundary voxel.

## Error model

`VoxelError`: `Parameters`, `FrameMismatch` (both frames and operation),
`CoordinateRange` (axis/range/halo), `VoxelBudgetExceeded` (required and
authorized voxels), `DenseVolumeOverflow` (dimensions), `EmptyOccupancy`,
`ExactnessRangeExceeded` (squared coordinate diameter), `Lattice`
`WorldCoordinateOutOfRange` (axis/world/normalized coordinate),
`Lattice` (offending element named), `Cloud`, `Graph`. Nothing silently
clamps, wraps, mutates after failed admission, or skips.

## Determinism class

**D0 on-target**: BTreeMap substrate ⇒ sorted iteration everywhere;
fixed DT pass order; deterministic query tie-breaks (distance, index);
BFS restarts at the lowest unvisited index.

## Cancellation behavior

Operations are bounded by active-set/box size; the chart polls nothing
itself (single-voxel lookups) — P7 by boundedness. DT and complement
construction require an explicit maximum dense voxel count. This is an
allocation/work admission bound, not an asynchronous cancellation point.

## Unsafe boundary

Zero `unsafe`.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs` (JSON verdicts, suite `fs-rep-voxel/conformance`):
rv-001 morphology vs brute force + algebra + spur removal; rv-002 DT
exactness vs O(n²) + 1-Lipschitz; rv-003 radius/kNN vs brute force +
sphere normals (the ring fixture DELIBERATELY breaks kNN connectivity —
it caught the propagation gap during development); rv-004 fnx
round-trip + degenerate refusals + level-set probe parity + realization
receipts; rv-005 the chart contract (inside/outside, DT-backed distance
near analytic, declared resolution error, out-of-box fallback); rv-006
non-finite-origin refusal, frame-mismatch/no-mutation, empty-chart
refusal, full-`i32` span and dense-volume budget refusal, and complement
halo refusal at both coordinate extrema, numeric-exactness refusal, and
exact voxel-cube support bounds, plus no-claim chart samples for NaN,
infinite, and huge finite world coordinates.

## No-claim boundaries

- **The DT densifies the ACTIVE BOUNDING BOX**: memory is box volume,
  not active count — far-flung sparse sets are refused unless the caller
  explicitly authorizes their checked box volume. The voxel budget does
  not promise that the host allocator can satisfy an imprudently large
  authorization. Tiled narrow-band DT is follow-up work with
  fs-rep-sdf's band machinery.
- **No DT exactness claim exists at or beyond a `2^52` maximum squared
  coordinate diameter**: those boxes return
  `ExactnessRangeExceeded` even if their voxel count budget is large
  enough. The limit protects integer representation and the separation
  margin of rational lower-envelope breakpoints.
- **Out-of-box chart queries scan active centers**: exact but O(active);
  bulk far-field queries should go through the SDF representations.
- **Morphology is 6-connected**: 26-connected structuring elements and
  true Euclidean openings (via the DT) are follow-ups.
- **Normal orientation is heuristic** (BFS + nearest-anchor): globally
  correct on orientable, reasonably sampled surfaces; adversarial
  topology can still fool it — fitting beads consume the normals WITH
  their cloud provenance.
- **Realization emits an SDF**, not a mesh: meshing goes through the
  Rep Router to fs-rep-mesh; junction blending is smooth-min (bounded
  overshoot), not exact fillet geometry.
- **No FrankenNumpy views yet** (the fnp-* bridge lands with the SoA
  bead's consumers).

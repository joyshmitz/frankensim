//! fs-viz — scientific visualization primitives. Layer: L5.
//!
//! A 10⁸-cell field is illegible as raw numbers; the job of visualization is to
//! compress it into a picture an agent can read in one glance. This v0 is the
//! verifiable core of that job — the pieces with ANALYTIC ground truth, so a
//! rendered topology is a certificate rather than a guess:
//!
//! - [`streamline_with_cx`] — admitted, cancellable, atomically published RK4
//!   integration of a flow field; on a rotation field the streamline is a
//!   circle (radius conserved), on a saddle field it is a hyperbola (`xy`
//!   conserved). [`streamline`] is the no-authority compatibility wrapper;
//! - [`classify_hessian`] — the Morse critical-point type (min / max / saddle)
//!   and index from a scalar field's Hessian — the atom of a Morse–Smale
//!   complex;
//! - [`Grid2::isocontour_crossings`] — bounded, fail-closed isocontour edge
//!   intersections of an admitted scalar grid, which on a circle SDF all lie
//!   on the circle.
//! - [`Grid3::isosurface`] — bounded deterministic marching tetrahedra from an
//!   owned x-fastest scalar grid to a renderer-ready indexed triangle mesh.
//! - [`ScalarField3`] — a bounded versioned artifact codec with explicit
//!   node/cell centering, quantity, and units for ledger composition.
//!
//! Deterministic for deterministic callbacks. Scoped streamline and contour
//! extraction consume the lower-layer [`fs_exec::Cx`] contract and identify
//! published artifacts with the workspace's [`fs_blake3`] owner.
